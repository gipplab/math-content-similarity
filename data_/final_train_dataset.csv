1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 120-139 (1995; Zbl 0846.53021)] and \\textit{K. Fukaya} [in: Proc. GARC Workshop, Seoul Nat. Univ. 1993, Lect. Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","If \(H\) is a hyperoval of \(\mathrm{PG}(2,2^h),\) denote with \(\mathcal E\) the set of all lines external to \(H\) and with \(\mathcal S\) the set of all lines secant to \(H\). Using such sets of lines, the authors define three different families of lines \({\mathcal A}_1,\) \({\mathcal A}_2\) \({\mathcal A}_3\) of \(\mathrm{PG}(2,2^h)\) whose dual is a \(k\)-arc. As the complement of a \(k\)-arc is an \(s\)-fold blocking set with \(s+k=2^h+1,\) they construct three examples of multiple blocking sets. The first and the third construction only apply to translation hyperovals.",0

The stack \\([Y_0/A]\\) is obtained by the iterated root constructions from a canonical stack whose coarse moduli space has a minimal resolution isomorphic to a (non-minimal resolution) of \\(\\mathbb{A}^2/G\\).

The authors study the following admittedly imprecise question: ``How ``small'' nowhere constant (pseudo-open) images can ``large'' spaces have?'', proving results of which the following represent the countable case:

1) Let \(X\) be a Tychonoff space with the countable chain condition. Then \(X\) has a nowhere constant Tychonoff image of weight \(\leq \omega_1\). Moreover, if the Suslin Hypothesis holds, \(X\) has a nowhere constant Tychonoff image of countable weight.

2) Let \(X\) be a Tychonoff space with the countable chain condition. Then \(X\) has a pseudo-open Tychonoff image of weight \(\leq 2^{\aleph_0}\).

Finally, the authors show that 1) is sharp by proving that every nowhere constant image of a Suslin Line has uncountable weight and they prove that 2) is consistently sharp, by exhibiting, under Martin's Axiom, an example of a Tychonoff space \(X\) with the countable chain condition such that every Hausdorff pseudo-open image of \(X\) has weight \(\geq 2^{\aleph_0}\).

However these results are not used (or even cited) in this paper. A great part of this not well organized and lengthy paper is devoted to technical results, unnecessary if the results in [Zbl 0721.14009] and [Zbl 0964.14012] had been used.\n\nReviewer's remark: The long introduction of the paper is very misleading. For instance it omits that the only case considered is the case of base point free canonical system. Also it states that ``One of the interesting implications of the main result is the existence of families of quadruple canonical covers with unbounded geometric genus and the existence of families with unbounded irregularity.'' In fact it turns out that these examples with \\(q> 0\\) are all well-known examples like the obvious example of a product of a genus 2 curve (not 3 as stated erroneously in remark 5.3) by an hyperelliptic genus \\(m+1\\) curve.\n\nIn the reviewer's opinion, the main interest of this paper is establishing that, under the restrictive assumptions considered, the only possible cases are the obvious and already known examples.",1

1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''.

Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 120-139 (1995; Zbl 0846.53021)] and \\textit{K. Fukaya} [in: Proc. GARC Workshop, Seoul Nat. Univ. 1993, Lect. Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","zbMATH_ID

14466,"The author extends the notion and results of real places on fields to commutative rings. Namely, given a commutative ring \\(R\\) a real place on \\(R\\) is a pair \\(\\sigma=({\\mathfrak p},\\sigma)\\), where \\({\\mathfrak p}\\) is a prime ideal of \\(R\\) and \\(\\overline\\sigma:\\kappa({\\mathfrak p})\\to k\\cup\\infty\\) is a \\(k\\)-place on the residue field of \\({\\mathfrak p}\\). If \\(k=\\mathbb{R}\\) the place is called real. The readers familiar with the notion of real spectra will surely have noticed the similarity of both constructions. Then the author considers the space \\(M(R)\\) of real places on \\(R\\) which is the collection of all the above pairs modulo some equivalence relation, and topologizes it with the quotient topology inherited by the canonical epimorphism \\(\\lambda:\\text{Spec}_ r(R)\\to M(R)\\).\n\n\nThis space \\(M(R)\\) was well known in case \\(R\\) is a field, and its properties extend naturally (and easily) to this more general situation, as well as other concepts as the one of holomorphy ring. So the results of the paper are essentially not new but the expected extensions of the known ones for fields, or in some cases reformulations in the language of real places of some known facts for the real spectrum, as theorem 4.3. -- - Also the author raises the question of the possible extension of some of the results to the case of \\(k\\)-places with \\(k\\neq\\mathbb{R}\\). Some work in this direction (always in the case of a field) was done by \\textit{H.-W. SchÃ¼lting} in GÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique rÃ©elle et formes quadratiques, JournÃ©e SMF, Univ. Rennes 1981, Lect. Notes Math. 959, 433-442 (1982; Zbl 0498.14013), where he works with the relative holomorphy ring. Finally the paper finishes by applying the results to the particular case of rings with many units and answering in the affirmative a question of \\textit{M. Knebusch}, namely whether the space \\(M_ T\\) of real places compatible with a given preorder \\(T\\) is Hausdorff.","This paper is concerned with the Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture: any piecewise-polynomial function can be expressed as a maximum of finite minima of finite collections of polynomials. The Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture was proved by \\textit{L. MahÃ©} in 1984 for \\(n\\leq2\\) [Rocky Mt. J. Math. 14, 983--985 (1984; Zbl 0578.41008)] but is still open for \\(n>2\\).\n\nIn the article under review the authors continue their quest for a real algebro-geometric proof of the conjecture via their Connectedness conjecture from [\\textit{F. Lucas, J. J. Madden, D. Schaub} and \\textit{M. Spivakovsky}, Manuscr. Math. 128, No. 4, 505--547 (2009; Zbl 1169.14039)]. As the main tool they use approximate roots of a regular local ring \\((A,{\\mathbf m})\\) equipped with a valuation centered in \\({\\mathbf m}\\). They establish a definable connectedness conjecture for \\(\\dim A=2\\), leading to a new proof of the MahÃ© theorem cited above.",1

1013949,"Let \\(K\\) be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, \\(F\\) be a vector space of dimension \\(n\\) and \\(S_\\lambda F\\) be the Schur module associated to the partition \\(\\lambda = (\\lambda_1 ,\\dots, \\lambda_m )\\), where \\(1 \\leq m \\leq n\\). Let \\(m \\leq r \\leq n\\). The variety \\(X_r\\) of tensors of rank \\(\\leq r\\) is defined to be the set of all tensors \\(v\\) in \\(S_\\lambda F\\) such that there exists a subspace \\(F'\\) of \\(F\\) with \\(\\text{dim } F' = r\\) and \\(v \\in S_\\lambda F' \\subset S_\\lambda F\\). When \\(\\lambda = (2)\\) or \\(\\lambda = (1,1)\\) these rank varieties are well-understood. In particular, the minimal free resolution of \\({\\mathcal O}_{X_r}\\) was described by \\textit{T. JÃ³zefiak}, \\textit{P. Pragacz} and \\textit{J. Weyman} [AstÃ©risque 87-88, 109-189 (1981; Zbl 0488.14012)]. The current paper uses the approach of this paper to generalize some of their results to rank varieties \\(X_r \\subset S_\\lambda F\\) for an arbitrary partition \\(\\lambda\\). The author gives a set of equations defining \\(X_r\\) set-theoretically and obtains a minimal free resolution of \\({\\mathcal O}_{X_r}\\). This yields the dimension of \\(X_r\\) and gives that they are normal and Cohen-Macaulay and have rational singularities. The author gives more precise results in the special case of rank varieties in \\(S_d F\\) for \\(d >2\\). Finally, the case of rank varieties of skewsymmetric tensors is studied.","Over a dozen years ago, I asked Jerzy Weyman to explain the geometric method of finding finite free resolutions to me. His answer was very clear. He convinced me that this is a technique worth learning. Furthermore, I believe that it is magical that both mathematical meanings for the word ``resolve'' come into play in this technique. Suppose \\(R\\) is the coordinate ring of the algebraic variety \\(Y\\). For the sake of concreteness, let us assume that \\(Y\\) is a subvariety of affine \\(N\\)-space over the algebraically closed field \\(\\mathbb K\\). In this setting, \\(R\\) is equal to \\(P/I\\), where \\(P\\) is a polynomial ring in \\(N\\) variables over \\(\\mathbb K\\) and \\(I\\) is the ideal of polynomials which vanish on \\(Y\\). To employ the geometric method for finding the resolution of \\(R\\) by free \\(P\\)-modules, one first resolves the singularity. Let \\(Z\\to Y\\) be a desingularization of \\(Y\\). Now, \\(Z\\) is smooth; so, \\(Z\\) is defined by a regular sequence and the coordinate ring of \\(Z\\) is resolved by the Koszul complex for this regular sequence. The Koszul complex resolution is the most completely understood and straightforward of all possible resolutions. To resolve the coordinate ring of \\(Y\\), one ``need only'' push the Koszul complex down to \\(Y\\) along the desingularization. Of course, the devil is in the details.\n\nThis geometric method was introduced by George Kempf in a series of papers which were published in the early 1970's. The first stunning application of this technique was made by Alain Lascoux in 1978. Suppose the variety \\(Y\\) is the ``determinantal variety'' of all linear transformations from \\(\\mathbb K^n\\to\\mathbb K^m\\) of rank less than \\(r\\). (In the present setting, \\(Y\\) is a subvariety of affine \\(N=mn\\) space.) Before Lascoux, the resolution of the coordinate ring, \\(R\\), of \\(Y\\) was known only when \\(r\\) is equal to the minimum of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) (this is the maximal order minor case and the resolution is the Eagon-Northcott resolution of 1962) or when \\(n=m\\) were equal and \\(r=n-1\\) (in this, submaximal, case, \\(R\\) is Gorenstein of codimension \\(4\\) and the resolution is the Gulliksen-NegÃ¥rd resolution of 1972). Lascoux combined the geometric method, the representation theory of the general linear group, and Raoul Bott's theorem about the cohomology of line bundles on homogeneous spaces to resolve the coordinate ring of all determinantal varieties in characteristic zero. The representation theory of general linear group is less complicated in characteristic zero than it is in positive characteristic. Also, Bott's theorem is definitely a characteristic zero theorem. On the other hand, the Eagon-Northcott complex, the Gulliksen-NegÃ¥rd complex, and the Akin-Buchsbaum-Weyman complex of 1981, which resolves the ring defined by submaximal minors for arbitrary \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) all are independent of characteristic. It was not known until Mitsuyasu Hashimoto's work in the 1990's that for general configurations of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(r\\), the Betti numbers of \\(R\\) really depend on the characteristic of \\(\\mathbb K\\).\n\nThe geometric method also applies to Schubert varieties in various homogeneous spaces, determinantal varieties for symmetric and alternating matrices, conjugacy classes in classical Lie algebras, varieties of complexes, and many more situations. Depending upon one's point of view (a geometer might start with a variety and look for the equations; whereas an algebraist might start with the equations) the geometric method allows one to find the coordinate ring of particular varieties, find the equations which vanish on the varieties, prove Cohen-Macaulayness, prove that certain varieties have rational singularities.\n\nIt is all here in one place, with one uniform notation throughout: the combinatorics and representation theory of Schur and Weyl modules, an explanation and proof of Bott's theorem, the geometric method laid out very slowly, and oodles of examples. Each chapter contains exercises which extend the material given in the text. Many of these exercises outline a way to re-do, using the geometric method, results which appear in the literature using ad-hoc methods. If you have considered learning this method, but have been intimidated away from pulling the ideas out of the existing published literature, then read this book. The value of having one uniform notation can not be overestimated. If you pull any two papers about Schur modules out of the literature, they will have different conventions about how a Ferrers diagram should be drawn and when a tableau is standard (and it does not matter if the two papers have the same author!). In the long run, the ideas work whether the boxes are stacked on the floor or hang from the ceiling; but in the short run, if one adopts Ian Macdonald's remedy ``Readers who prefer this convention should read this book upside down in a mirror'', then one is likely to suffer eye strain, if not more serious disorientation.\n\nI have one slight caution to readers of Weyman's book. The phrase ``If \\(R\\) has characteristic zero'' almost always means ``If \\(R\\) contains a field of characteristic zero''. In particular, the ring of integers is not one of the rings under consideration. In practice, almost all calculations are made over a field and then transferred to an arbitrary ring by way of a base change; so there really is no confusion, unless one picked up one page out of context without knowing the general approach.\n\nThe book under review has instantly became the standard reference. I have seen referees' reports that have instructed the author to ``express the results in the language of Weyman's new book''. I am aware of numerous seminars that are reading Weyman's book and finding new applications of its methods.",1

The last results of Mori-Kawamata-Shokurov are very close to the complete proof of Reid's conjecture. - The author shows that if on a threefold V all the adjunction series \(| D+nK_ V|\) terminate for \(n\gg 0,\) then \(K_ X\) is not numerically effective for any model of V with canonical singularities. Hence, if V has a minimal model, then it is birationally equivalent to a variety of one of the following types: a Fano variety (possibly singular), a Del Pezzo fibering over some curve or a conic bundle over some surface. This is the Iskovskikh conjecture for threefolds with chain condition for adjunctions. Thus the Iskovskikh conjecture is proved modulo Reid's conjecture.",0

Name: text, dtype: object","If \(\mu\) is a non-atomic measure, then the unit sphere of \(L_1(\mu)\) fails to possess any extreme points; in fact, every point of the unit sphere is even the midpoint of a segment of length~\(2\) in the unit sphere; i.e.,
\[
 \forall \varphi\in L_1(\mu) \;\exists \psi\in L_1(\mu) \quad \|\varphi\pm\psi\| = \|\varphi\| = \|\psi\|. \eqno(1)
\]
 The authors investigate this phenomenon in the setting of non-commutative \(L_1\)-spaces, that is, preduals \(M_*\) of von Neumann algebras~\(M\). They prove that (1) holds for \(M_*\) if \(M\) does not contain type I or type III\(_1\) factors as direct summands and that (1) fails if \(M\) is the hyperfinite III\(_1\) factor. On the other hand, they show that if (and only if) \(M\) is diffuse, (1) is always fulfilled ``up to~\(\varepsilon\)'':
\[
 \forall \varepsilon>0 \;\forall \varphi\in M_* \;\exists \psi_\varepsilon\in M_* \quad \|\varphi\| = \|\psi_\varepsilon\|,\;\bigl| \|\varphi\pm\psi_\varepsilon\| - \|\varphi\| \bigr| < \varepsilon.

In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 120-139 (1995; Zbl 0846.53021)] and \\textit{K. Fukaya} [in: Proc. GARC Workshop, Seoul Nat. Univ. 1993, Lect. Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","Summary: We compute the prepotentials and the geometry of the moduli spaces for a Calabi-Yau manifold and its mirror. In this way we obtain all the sigma model corrections to the Yukawa couplings and moduli space metric for the original manifold. The moduli space is found to be subject to the action of a modular group which, among other operations, exchanges large and small values of the radius, though the action on the radius is not as simple as \\(R \\to 1/R\\). It is also shown that the quantum corrections to the coupling decompose into a sum over instanton contributions and moreover that this sum converges. In particular there are no `sub-instanton' corrections. This sum over instantons points to a deep connection between the modular group and the rational curves of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The burden of the present work is that a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds is an exactly soluble superconformal theory, at least as far as the massless sector is concerned. Mirror pairs are also more general than exactly soluble models that have hitherto been discussed since we solve the theory for all points of the moduli space.",1

Here, a contact structure on such a manifold is said to be horizontal if the contact planes (oriented by the differential of the contact form) are positively transverse to the fibers of the bundles involved in the plumbing, and the plumbing tree is said to be non-positive if for every vertex of the tree the sum of the degree of the vertex and the Euler number of the bundle corresponding to that vertex is non-positive.

1262405,"From the text: ``In his article [Stud. Adv. Math. 9, 121-160 (1998; Zbl 0904.58009)] in this volume's precursor, \\textit{E. Witten} proposed, as a possible approach to constructing a mirror map, a certain extended moduli space \\({\\mathcal N}\\), a thickening of the usual moduli space \\({\\mathcal M}\\) of complex structures on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\). Witten's proposal for \\({\\mathcal N}\\) is couched in terms of conformal field theory on \\(X\\), and it is not immediately obvious to the author to what extent it is or can be made rigorous. In any case, it appears to be an intriguing problem of pure deformation theory to construct Witten's extended moduli space directly in terms of ordinary complex geometry, making no appeal to physics.\n\n\nThe purpose of this note is to describe a type of generalized or `exotic' deformation of complex structure on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\). Our construction shares with Witten's the property that the set of first-order deformations coincides with the total DeRham cohomology \\(\\bigoplus H^i(X)\\), with the classical deformations embedded as \\(H^{1,n-1}(X)\\); but the author's incompetence in physical matters precludes any further comment here as to any real connection between the two constructions.\n\n\nWe describe a kind of deformation of the anti-DeRham algebra on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\). These deformations are in 1-1 correspondence with the total cohomology \\(\\bigoplus H^i(X,\\mathbb{C})\\)''.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0905.00079].","Starting with a differential graded Lie algebra \\(t\\) and its associated formal (graded) moduli space \\({\\mathcal M}_t\\), the authors define the structure of a formal Frobenius manifold on the graded vector space \\(H^*(M,\\Lambda^* T_M)\\), where \\(M\\) denotes the underlying connected compact complex manifold. There is a conjecture about relations of the constructed Frobenius manifold to Gromov-Witten invariance of the dual manifold \\(\\widetilde M\\).\n\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Introduction; 1.

Therefore, one can promote any (known) black hole solution of ungauged supergravity with \\(k=+1\\) to a solution of gauged supergravity with an arbitrary \\(k\\).

This solution is specified by three charges, the asymptotic negative cosmological constant (minimum of the potential) and a non-extremality parameter. While its BPS-saturated limit has a naked singularity, we find a lower bound on the non-extremality parameter (or equivalently on the ADM mass) for which the non-extreme solutions are regular. When this bound is saturated the extreme (non-supersymmetric) solution has zero Hawking temperature and finite entropy.

14466,"The author extends the notion and results of real places on fields to commutative rings.

If \\(k=\\mathbb{R}\\) the place is called real. The readers familiar with the notion of real spectra will surely have noticed the similarity of both constructions. Then the author considers the space \\(M(R)\\) of real places on \\(R\\) which is the collection of all the above pairs modulo some equivalence relation, and topologizes it with the quotient topology inherited by the canonical epimorphism \\(\\lambda:\\text{Spec}_ r(R)\\to M(R)\\).\n\n\nThis space \\(M(R)\\) was well known in case \\(R\\) is a field, and its properties extend naturally (and easily) to this more general situation, as well as other concepts as the one of holomorphy ring. So the results of the paper are essentially not new but the expected extensions of the known ones for fields, or in some cases reformulations in the language of real places of some known facts for the real spectrum, as theorem 4.3. -- - Also the author raises the question of the possible extension of some of the results to the case of \\(k\\)-places with \\(k\\neq\\mathbb{R}\\).

1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr.

Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","The authors consider a homogeneous fragmentation process in which there is an additional killing upon crossing a certain space-time barrier (the killing mechanism is defined in Section 1.2).

After an introduction, in Section 2 the authors provide some general notions that are used in the subsequent part of the paper and they discuss the connection between fragmentation and Lévy processes.

Then, Section 3 is concerned with the proof of Theorem 2 and in Section 4 they provide the proof of Theorem 3, presented in the Introduction. To this end, the authors use an auxiliary lemma which states that, for any \(n\in \mathbb N\), there exists a time such that with positive probability the fragmentation process has at least \(n\) blocks.

In the next section, they introduce a multiplicative process and examine when this process is a martingale.

Then the authors consider an additive process which also turns out to be a martingale and whose limit is studied with regard to strict positivity.

Finally, the authors deal with the asymptotic behaviour of the largest fragment in the killed fragmentation process.",0

The author introduces a concept of admissible two-sided \\(k\\)-vector spaces and defines for such a space a noncommutative analog of the symmetric algebra. Then he computes the skew fields of fractions for some classes of admissible two-sided vector spaces. The components of degree zero of these skew fields can be considered as function fields of noncommutative ruled surfaces (cf. [\\textit{M. Artin, M. Van den Bergh}, J. Algebra 133, No. 2, 249-271 (1990; Zbl 0717.14001)]). As an application a clear description of the birational equivalence classes of certain types of such surfaces is obtained.","Let \(M\) be the set of all finite complex-valued Borel measures \(\mu\not\equiv0\) on \(\mathbf R\). Set \(l(\mu)=\inf(\text{supp}\,\mu)\). The classical Titchmarsh convolution theorem claims that if measures \(\mu_1, \mu_2,\dots,\mu_n\) belong to \(M\) and satisfy \(l(\mu_j)>-\infty\), \(j=1,2,\dots,n,\) then
\[
l(\mu_1\ast\mu_2\ast\dots\ast\mu_n)=l(\mu_1)+l(\mu_2)+\dots+(\mu_n),\tag{1}

\[
| \mu_j| ((-\infty,x))=O(\exp(-c| x| )),\quad x\to-\infty,\quad\text{for all}\quad c>0,\tag{2}
\]
 and \(\mu_n=\mu_1+\mu_2+\dots+\mu_{n-1}\), then (1) remains true. Condition (2) is sharp: the statement ceases to be true if `for all' in (2) is replaced with `there exists'. This theorem is derived from the following factorization theorem in the class \(H^\infty(\mathbf C_+)\) of functions analytic and bounded in the upper half-plane \(\mathbf C_+\): Let \(h\not\equiv0\) belong to \(H^\infty(\mathbf C_+)\). Suppose that \(h=g_1\cdot g_2\cdot \dots\cdot g_n\), where the functions \(g_j\), \(j=1,2,\dots,n\), \(n\geq3\), are analytic in \(\mathbf C_+\) and satisfy the conditions: (i) there exists \(H>0\) such that \(\sup\{\sum_{j=1}^n| g_j(z)| :0<\text{Im}\, z<H\}<\infty\); (ii) \(g_1,g_2,\dots,g_{n-1}\) are linearly independent over \(\mathbf C\) and \(g_n=g_1+g_2+\dots+g_{n-1}\). Then there exist constants \(b_j\in\mathbf R\) such that \(g_j(z)\exp(ib_jz)\in H^\infty(\mathbf C_+)\), \(j=1,2,\dots,n\). The proof of this theorem is based on the corollary of H.~Cartan second main theorem for analytic curves and on the representation for functions harmonic in \(\mathbf C_+\), which is of independent interest: Let \(u\) be a real-valued function harmonic in \(\mathbf C_+\), which satisfies the conditions: (i) there exists a sequence \(\{r_k\}_{k=1}^\infty\), \(r_k\to\infty\), such that
\[
\int_0^\pi u^+(re^{i\varphi})\sin\varphi \,d\varphi\leq\exp(o(r)),\quad r=r_k\to\infty;

 (ii) there exists \(H>0\), such that \(\sup_{0<y<H}\int_{-\infty}^\infty| u(x+iy)| (1+x^2)^{-1}\,dx<\infty.\) Then \(u\) admits the representation
\[
u(z)=\frac{y}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{d\nu(t)}{(t-x)^2+y^2}+ky,\quad z=x+iy\in\mathbf C_+,

1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr.

B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A.

In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them.

The author generalized it to links in rational homology three-spheres [\textit{P. M. Gilmer}, J. Knot Theory Ramifications 2, No.3, 285--320 (1993; Zbl 0797.57003)].

In this paper the author studies real algebraic curves with only real nodal singularities, where a nodal singularity is a transverse crossing of two branches. Given such a curve \(C\) one can associate a link \(\mathcal{T}(C)\) in the tangent circle bundle over the real projective plane \(\mathbb{RP}(2)\). Then, since the circle bundle over \(\mathbb{RP}(2)\) is a rational homology three-sphere (in fact it is homeomorphic to the lens space of type \((4,3)\) [\textit{P. Gilmer}, Pac. J.

If \\(k=\\mathbb{R}\\) the place is called real. The readers familiar with the notion of real spectra will surely have noticed the similarity of both constructions. Then the author considers the space \\(M(R)\\) of real places on \\(R\\) which is the collection of all the above pairs modulo some equivalence relation, and topologizes it with the quotient topology inherited by the canonical epimorphism \\(\\lambda:\\text{Spec}_ r(R)\\to M(R)\\).\n\n\nThis space \\(M(R)\\) was well known in case \\(R\\) is a field, and its properties extend naturally (and easily) to this more general situation, as well as other concepts as the one of holomorphy ring. So the results of the paper are essentially not new but the expected extensions of the known ones for fields, or in some cases reformulations in the language of real places of some known facts for the real spectrum, as theorem 4.3. -- - Also the author raises the question of the possible extension of some of the results to the case of \\(k\\)-places with \\(k\\neq\\mathbb{R}\\). Some work in this direction (always in the case of a field) was done by \\textit{H.-W. SchÃ¼lting} in GÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique rÃ©elle et formes quadratiques, JournÃ©e SMF, Univ. Rennes 1981, Lect.

Finally the paper finishes by applying the results to the particular case of rings with many units and answering in the affirmative a question of \\textit{M. Knebusch}, namely whether the space \\(M_ T\\) of real places compatible with a given preorder \\(T\\) is Hausdorff.","The real holomorphy ring of a commutative ring \\(R\\) is defined to be the subring \\(H(R)\\) of elements which are globally finite on the real spectrum of \\(R\\). The authors present an extensive investigation of such real holomorphy rings. Suppose \\(A\\) is a real affine domain over \\({\\mathbb R}\\), \\(F\\) is the quotient field of \\(A\\) and \\(V\\) is the associated real affine variety. It is proved that \\(A\\subseteq H(F)\\) iff the set of all central real points of \\(V\\) is compact. Moreover, if the subspace of singular, real points of V is compact then \\(H(A)=A\\cap H(F)\\). Considering the sequence \\(H(R), H(H(R)), \\ldots ,H^n(R)\\) of iterated real homomorphism rings, the authors show that if \\(\\dim R=d\\), then \\(H^{d+1}(R)=H^d(R)\\). \n\n\nFor the semigroup of sums of higher powers holds the following: \n\\[\n\\text{Sat}(1+\\sum R^2)=\\text{Sat}(1+\\sum R^{2n})= \\bigcap_{{\\mathbf p}\\in\\text{Spec } R, {\\mathbf p}\\text{-real}} (R\\setminus {\\mathbf p}),\n\\]\n where \\(\\text{Sat}(S)=\\{s \\in R \\mid \\exists_{s'\\in S} ss'\\in S\\}\\) for any multiplicative semigroup \\(S\\) in \\(R\\). \n\n\nThe most complete results are obtained for rings satisfying \\(1+\\sum R^2 \\subseteq R^*\\).

1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 120-139 (1995; Zbl 0846.53021)] and \\textit{K. Fukaya} [in: Proc. GARC Workshop, Seoul Nat. Univ. 1993, Lect. Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","The development of direct economic methods for the solution of Poisson's equation in planar domains of a complex geometry leads to the necessity of computing values of the logarithmic potential in a neighborhood of a boundary curve. The specifics of the problem require that the computation of the logarithmic potential be more economic than the Marsh algorithm for Poisson's equation in a rectangle and have second order accuracy for densities of low smoothness.


In this paper a method for solving this problem is presented based on a jump theorem for a normal derivative of the logarithmic potential. The method has second order accuracy for densities with bounded third derivative and is not worse than the Marsh algorithm with respect to the asymptotic number of arithmetic operations.",0

The problem is reformulated as a Cauchy principal value integral equation which also contains the potential at the control point. This is then amenable to numerial treatment by conventional methods. An alternative formulation is given in the better known form containing the tangential derivative of the potential. The simpler two-dimensional problem for an open arc is treated separately.",0

The first proof of the conjecture came in two steps. It was shown by \textit{E. Getzler} and \textit{R. Pandharipande} that the statement follows from the Virasoro conjecture for \(\mathbb P^2\); in fact only the degree \(0\) part is necessary [J. Nucl. Phys., B 530, No. 3, 701--714 (1998; Zbl 0957.14038)]. The Virasoro constraints for \(\mathbb P^2\) were later established by Givental.

The current paper gives a more direct proof of the conjecture. Mumford's relations are used to remove the lambda insertions, thus reducing the problem to identities between integrals involving only \(\psi\)-classes; these are the subject of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem. The proof then relies on skilfull combinatorial manipulations.

Finally, another proof of the conjecture was recently given by \textit{A. Buryak} and \textit{S. Shadrin} [``A new proof of Faber's intersection number conjecture'', \url{arXiv:0912.5115}].

If the operators do not commute, there is no canonical definition even for the simple function \(f(x_1,x_2)=x_1x_2\). For the Weyl calculus which is motivated from quantum mechanics and defined by a Fourier transform in Banach spaces, the symmetric average \((A_1A_2+A_2A_1)/2\) is chosen. However, even in rather simple situations the Weyl calculus and even its support (considering the Weyl calculus as an operator-valued tempered distribution) can be very hard to determine. This support is one of several possible natural definitions for the spectrum of the \(n\)-tuple \((A_1,\ldots,A_n)\) (if the Weyl calculus is defined which requires some exponential growth estimate).

In Clifford analyis, a similar symmetric average as above occurs when the polynomial \(f\) is extended to a monogenic function which motivates some connections employed in the present monograph.

After a thorough introduction to the Weyl calculus and Clifford analysis in Sections~1--3, Section~4 makes use of the analogue of the Cauchy integral formula in Clifford analysis to define and study a ``monogenic calculus'' as an analogue of the Riesz-Dunford calculus. It applies for an \(n\)-tuple of bounded operators for which \(\xi_1A_1+\cdots+\xi_nA_n\) has a real spectrum for real \(\xi_j\). This spectral condition is also necessary for the exponential growth estimate of the Weyl calculus, but it is in general not sufficient. If the growth estimate also holds, the Weyl calculus and the monogenic calculus coincide.

Section~5 is devoted to the finite-dimensional settting. It is shown that the above spectral condition is for matrices even sufficient for the exponential growth estimate of the Weyl calculus. In this case, a formula, originally due to E. Nelson, allowing a more explicit calculation, is derived. Moreover, the joint spectrum is located within the joint numerical range in the case of two Hermitian matrices by geometric means; further cases like simultaneously triangularizable matrices are also discussed.

In Section~6, unbounded operators are considered, and the above spectral condition is relaxed to some sectorial condition. To this end, some results about monogenic extension of functions in sectors are established.

The final Section~7 observes a connection with the Feynman calculus which arose from the Feynman integral. The Feynman calculus generalizes the Weyl calculus in the sense that not necessarily the symmetric average plays the key role for polynomials but instead some ``disentangling'' operation determined by probability measures.",0

The extension to arbitrary isotropic dilation matrices necessitates the introduction of the concepts of restricted and renormalized convergence of a subdivision scheme as well as the notion of subconvergence, i.e., the convergence of only a subsequence of the iterations of the subdivision scheme. Since, in addition, factorization methods pass even from scalar to matrix valued refinable functions, those results have to be formulated in terms of matrix refinable functions or vector subdivision schemes, respectively, in order to be suitable for iterated application. Moreover, it is shown for a particular case that the condition is not only a necessary but also a sufficient one.",1
1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties.

The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures.

The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories.

This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A.

In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","The polynomial representation of cohomology classes in the middle cohomology group of hypersurfaces allows one to explicitly calculate the Picard-Fuchs equations, or in fact the Gauss-Manin connection for families of hypersurfaces.

It is natural to ask whether the method of Jacobian rings for the calculation of the Hodge structure can be extended to the case of hypersurfaces in projective toric varieties.\n\n\nThere is one more strong reason why the calculation of the variation of the Hodge structure of hypersurfaces in toric varieties is especially important for physicists. The most interesting class of variations of Hodge structure in physics is connected with families of Calabi-Yau varieties. First, it is possible to construct many examples of families of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties \\(\\mathbb{P}_ \\Delta\\) associated with reflexive polyhedra \\(\\Delta\\). Second, for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties we can use a precise mathematical definition of mirrors via the notion of dual polyhedron. The main idea can be also explained for families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds as follows:\n\n\nThere are two kinds of Yukawa couplings on the Hodge spaces \\(H^{2,1} (W)\\) and \\(H^{1,1} (W)\\) considered by physicists for Calabi-Yau 3-folds \\(W\\). It is known that the Yukawa coupling on \\(H^{2,1} (W)\\) is defined by the deformation of the complex structure, but the definition of the Yukawa coupling on \\(H^{1,1} (W)\\) is outside the classical algebraic geometry. Physicists have discovered a trick, the so-called mirror symmetry, which allows one to replace the calculation of the ``mysterious Yukawa coupling'' on \\(H^{1,1} (W)\\) by the calculation of the Yukawa coupling on the space \\(H^{2,1} (W')\\) corresponding to the deformation of the complex structure on another Calabi-Yau 3-fold \\(W'\\). The Calabi- Yau variety \\(W'\\) is called a mirror of \\(W\\). Since the mirror mapping for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties admits a precise mathematical definition, we can compute both of the Yukawa couplings using only deformations of the classical Hodge structures. One should remark that in the general case the construction of mirrors for Calabi-Yau manifolds is a rather difficult problem, and Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties are now the only known cases in which this problem is solved by mathematical methods.\n\n\nDenote by \\(\\mathbb{T}\\) the \\(n\\)-dimensional algebraic torus \\((\\mathbb{C}^*)^ n\\). The main purpose of this paper is to give the explicit description of the mixed Hodge structure of the affine \\(\\Delta\\)-regular hypersurface \\(Z_ f \\subset \\mathbb{T}\\) defined by a Laurent polynomial \\(f\\) with the Newton polyhedron \\(\\Delta\\). As an application of our calculation of the infinitesimal variations of mixed Hodge structures, we show under some restrictions the following property of the mirror mapping for Calabi-Yau varieties:\n\n\nThe topological cup product on the cohomology ring \\(\\bigoplus^{n- 1}_{i = 0} H^{i,i}(W)\\) of smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric Fano \\(n\\)-folds can be obtained as a ``limit'' of the multiplicative structure on the chiral ring \\(\\bigoplus^{n-1}_{i = 0} H^{n-1-i,i} (W')\\) of the mirrors \\(W'\\), where the ``limit'' corresponds to some degeneration of \\(W'\\) at a boundary point of the moduli space of complex structures on \\(W'\\).\n\n\nThis property of the mirror mapping agrees with predictions of physicists.",1

In any case, it appears to be an intriguing problem of pure deformation theory to construct Witten's extended moduli space directly in terms of ordinary complex geometry, making no appeal to physics.\n\n\nThe purpose of this note is to describe a type of generalized or `exotic' deformation of complex structure on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\). Our construction shares with Witten's the property that the set of first-order deformations coincides with the total DeRham cohomology \\(\\bigoplus H^i(X)\\), with the classical deformations embedded as \\(H^{1,n-1}(X)\\); but the author's incompetence in physical matters precludes any further comment here as to any real connection between the two constructions.\n\n\nWe describe a kind of deformation of the anti-DeRham algebra on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\).

The McKay correspondence is realized as follows: there exists a natural integral basis of the Grothendieck group \\(K(Y)\\) given by natural bundles \\(\\mathcal{R}_k\\) indexed by the irreducible representations of \\(G\\). This provides, through Chern character, a rational basis of the cohomology \\(H^*(Y,\\mathbb{Q})\\) in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible representations of \\(G\\). It is still an open problem to get a similar correspondence for the integral cohomology \\(H^*(Y,\\mathbb{Z})\\). Reid conjectured that some ``cookery'' with the Chern classes of these bundles \\(\\mathcal{R}_k\\) should provide an integral basis. This paper establishes explicitly this integral McKay correspondence for all abelian subgroups \\(A\\) in \\(\\text{SL}(3,\\mathbb{C})\\) (Theorem 1.1). The method follows the recipe introduced by Reid, uses previous work of \\textit{Y. Ito, H.

The integral basis of \\(H^2(Y,\\mathbb{Z})\\) is then given by the first Chern classes of some \\(\\mathcal{R}_k\\)'s indexed by specific non-trivial characters (Proposition 7.1). In order to base \\(H^4(Y,\\mathbb{Z})\\), the author computes all relations between the line bundles (since the group is abelian) \\(\\mathcal{R}_k\\) in \\(\\text{Pic}(Y)\\), and introduces a family of virtual bundles \\(\\mathcal{V}_m\\) indexed by the remaining non-trivial irreducible representations, whose second Chern classes will give the expected integral basis (Proposition 7.3).",1

We give criteria for the mirror map \\(q\\)-series of certain families of Calabi-Yau manifolds to be automorphic functions. For families of elliptic curves and lattice polarized \\(K3\\) surfaces with surjective period mappings, global Torelli theorems allow one to present these criteria in terms of the ramification behavior of natural algebraic invariants - the functional and generalized functional invariants respectively. In particular, when applied to one parameter families of rank 19 lattice polarized \\(K3\\) surfaces, our criterion demystifies the Mirror-Moonshine phenomenon of Lian and Yau and highlights its non-monstrous nature. The lack of global Torelli theorems and presence of instanton corrections makes Calabi-Yau threefold families more complicated. Via the constraints of special geometry, the Picard-Fuchs equations for one parameter families of Calabi-Yau threefolds imply a differential equation criterion for automorphicity of the mirror map in terms of the Yukawa coupling. In the absence of instanton corrections, the projective periods map to a twisted cubic space curve. A hierarchy of ``algebraic'' instanton corrections correlated with the differential Galois group of the Picard-Fuchs equation is proposed.",1

In this last case, the closure in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta \(\Gamma(f)\) of \(\{f^{\circ n}\}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb T^k \times F\), where \(k=1,2\) and \(F\) is a finite group.

In the paper under review, the authors prove that in cases (1) and (2) \(\Omega\) is completely hyperbolic (before it was known that \(\Omega\) is taut) while in case (3) when \(\Gamma(f)\simeq \mathbb T^2\times F\), they prove that \(\Omega\) is taut.

The idea of the proof in case (1) is particularly simple: every Cauchy sequence in the Kobayashi distance in \(\Omega\) can be mapped via \(f^{\circ N}\) for \(N\) sufficiently big into a compact Kobayashi ball centered at the fixed point of \(f\) in \(\Omega\), and being \(f\) proper, the sequence must be convergent. In case (2) a similar argument holds, using the fact that \(\Gamma(f)\) contains a holomorphic retraction from \(\Omega\) to \(\Sigma\).

This improves a bound in a previous paper which was below the above smallest known volume; in the same paper the authors proved also that the above hypothesis on the 2-generator subgroups is fulfilled if the first Betti number of \(M\) is at least three.

Our construction shares with Witten's the property that the set of first-order deformations coincides with the total DeRham cohomology \\(\\bigoplus H^i(X)\\), with the classical deformations embedded as \\(H^{1,n-1}(X)\\); but the author's incompetence in physical matters precludes any further comment here as to any real connection between the two constructions.\n\n\nWe describe a kind of deformation of the anti-DeRham algebra on a Calabi-Yau manifold \\(X\\). These deformations are in 1-1 correspondence with the total cohomology \\(\\bigoplus H^i(X,\\mathbb{C})\\)''.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0905.00079].","The authors study a three-unit network of neural cells with delayed coupling

Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung sind: 1. Die alte Theorie von \textit{Coulomb} und \textit{Poncelet} und die Theorie von \textit{Rebhann} beruhen zwar dem Anscheine nach auf verschiedenen Prinzipien, verschmelzen aber zu einem einzigen Verfahren und führen zu denselben Resultaten, sobald für den Winkel \(\nu\) (des Erddrucks gegen die Normale zur Stützmauer) dieselben Werte genommen werden.

We describe the structure of \\(\\text{Hilb}^G (\\mathbb{A}^2)\\) and prove this is the minimal resolution of the quotient surface singularity \\(\\mathbb{A}^2/G\\).","The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between non-trivial irreducible representations of a finite subgroup \\(\\Gamma\\) of \\(\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})\\) and irreducible components of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution of the quotient surface singularity \\(X_\\Gamma:= \\mathbb{C}^2/\\Gamma\\). This was discovered by J. McKay around 1980, using a rather formal approach. There was much subsequent work trying to give a more geometric description of the procedure. Among others, there were relevant contributions of Gonzalez-Springerg, Verdier, Esnault, Artin, working with suitable auxiliary reflexive sheaves. Later ItÃ´ and Nakamura used certain Hilbert schemes of zero-dimensional subschemes of the plane and Kapranov and Vasserot introduced suitable derived categories to describe the correspondence. Also attempts were made to generalize the theory. For instance, Riemenschneider conjectured that a similar correspondence could be obtained by using certain finite subgroups of \\(\\text{GL}(2,\\mathbb{C})\\) (namely, the small ones, i.e. those freely acting on \\(\\mathbb{C}^2-(0, 0)\\)) and certain representations thereof (the so-called special ones). The conjecture was proved by \\textit{A. Ishii} [J. Reine Angew. Math. 549, 221--233 (2002; Zbl 1057.14057)], using Hilbert schemes and derived categories techniques.\n\n In the present article, the author reviews these and other developments and shows that for a cyclic quotient singularity Ishii's theorem can be proved relatively easily [by using results of \\textit{R. Kidoh}, Hokkaido Math. J. 30, No. 1, 91--103 (2001; Zbl 1015.14004)]. The author also presents a theorem giving several equivalent characterizations of the notion of special representation.

Then he computes the skew fields of fractions for some classes of admissible two-sided vector spaces. The components of degree zero of these skew fields can be considered as function fields of noncommutative ruled surfaces (cf. [\\textit{M. Artin, M. Van den Bergh}, J. Algebra 133, No. 2, 249-271 (1990; Zbl 0717.14001)]). As an application a clear description of the birational equivalence classes of certain types of such surfaces is obtained.","Let \\(k\\) be a perfect field, and let \\(K/k\\) be a finite extension. This article studies the geometry of noncommutative spaces (Grothendieck categories) of the form \\(\\text{Proj }\\mathbb S_K(V)\\) where \\(V\\) is a \\(k\\)-central \\(K - K\\)- bimodule which is two-dimensional as a vector space via the right and left actions of \\(K\\) on \\(V\\). \\(\\text{Proj }\\mathbb S_K(V)=\\mathbb P_K(V)\\) denotes the quotient of the category of graded right \\(\\mathbb S_K(V)\\)-modules modulo the full subcategory of direct limits of right bounded modules. The space \\(\\mathbb P_K(V)\\) is called the \\textit{arithmetic} projective line, and one of the main issues of this article is to show that its geometry has close connection to data associated with \\(K/k\\). The noncommutative projective lines serves as basic examples in the field of noncommutative arithmetic geometry.\n\nArtin's conjecture states that the division ring of fractions of a noncommutative surface, not finite over its center, is the function field of a noncommutative \\(\\mathbb P^1\\)-bundle over a smooth commutative curve. As a noncommutative projective line is a noncommutative \\(\\mathbb P^1\\)-bundle over the point \\(\\text{Spec }K\\), this article provides a model for the geometry of noncommutative \\(\\mathbb P^1\\)-bundles over smooth commutative curves.\n\nThe article gives isomorphism invariants of noncommutative projective lines, and questions if these are also birational. If Artins conjecture is true, then noncommutative surfaces, infinite over their center, will have the same birational invariants as noncommutative \\(\\mathbb P^1\\)-bundles over smooth commutative curves, and this indicates which invariants that are the interesting ones.\n\nThe author justifies the name ``noncommutative projective line''. It is proved that these spaces are noetherian, Ext-finite, homological dimension one categories, also having a Serre functor. The first main result states that noncommutative projective lines are integral (in a defined sense), that the line bundles over a noncommutative projective line are indexed by \\(\\mathbb Z\\), and that every vector bundle over a noncommutative projective line is a direct sum of line bundles.\n\nUsing the classification of vector bundles, the author classify noncommutative projective lines up to \\(k\\)-linear equivalence. The statement is that there is a \\(k\\)-linear equivalence \\(\\mathbb P_K(V)\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(W)\\) if and only if there exists a \\(\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) such that either \\(V\\simeq K_\\delta\\otimes_K K_{\\epsilon}\\) or \\(V\\simeq K_\\delta\\otimes_K W^\\ast\\otimes_K K_{\\epsilon}\\).

This allows the author to sharpen the classification of noncommutative projective lines: For \\(\\mathrm{char} k\\neq 2\\) and \\(V_i\\) a rank 2 two-sided vector space for \\(i=1,2\\), there is a \\(k\\)-linear equivalence \\(\\mathbb P_K(V_1)\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(V_2)\\) if and only if (1) there exists \\(\\sigma_i\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) such that \\(V_i\\simeq K_{\\sigma_i}\\oplus K_{\\sigma_i}\\). In this case, \\(\\mathbb P(V_i)\\) is equivalent to the commutative projective line over \\(K\\), (2) there exists \\(\\sigma_i, \\tau_i\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k),\\) with \\(\\sigma_i\\neq\\tau_i\\), \\(V_i\\simeq K_{\\sigma_i}\\oplus K_{\\tau_i}\\) and under the action of \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)^2\\) on itself defined by \\((\\sigma,\\tau)\\cdot(\\delta,\\epsilon)=(\\delta^{-1}\\sigma\\epsilon,\\delta^{-1}\\tau\\epsilon)\\) the orbit of \\((\\sigma_1,\\tau_1)\\) contains an element of the set \\(\\{(\\sigma_2,\\tau_2),(\\sigma_2^{-1},\\tau_2^{-1}),(\\tau_2,\\sigma_2),(\\tau_2^{-1},\\sigma_2^{-1})\\}\\), (3) \\(V_i\\simeq V(\\lambda_i)\\), and under the action of \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)^2\\) on \\(\\Lambda(K)\\) defined by \\(\\lambda^G\\cdot(\\delta,\\epsilon)=(\\overline{\\delta}^{-1}\\lambda\\epsilon)^G\\), the orbit of \\(\\lambda_1^G\\) contains either \\(\\lambda_2^G\\) or \\(\\mu_2^G\\). \\(\\overline{\\delta}\\) denotes an extension of \\(\\delta\\) to \\(\\overline{K}\\).\n\nThe author gives the definition of the three types of canonical equivalences between noncommutative projective lines. Then the classification of \\(k\\)-linear equivalences \\(\\mathbb P_K(V)\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(W)\\) upto isomorphism can be given for \\(\\mathrm{char} k \\neq 2\\): Let \\(F:\\mathbb P_K(V)\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(W)\\) be a \\(k\\)-linear equivalence. Then there exists \\(\\delta_i\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\), an isomorphism \\(\\phi:K_{\\delta}^{-1}\\otimes_K V\\otimes_K K_{\\epsilon}\\rightarrow W^{i^\\ast}\\) inducing an equivalence \\(\\Phi:\\mathbb P_K(K_{\\delta^{-1}}\\otimes_K V\\otimes_K K_{\\epsilon})\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(W^{i\\ast})\\) and an integer \\(i\\) such that \\(F[-i]\\circ\\Phi\\circ T_{\\delta,\\epsilon}\\). Also, \\(\\delta,\\epsilon, i\\) are unique up to natural equivalence, while \\(\\Phi\\) is naturally equivalent to \\(\\Phi^\\prime\\) if and only if there exist nonzero \\(a,b,\\in K\\) such that \\(\\phi^\\prime\\phi^{-1}(w)=a\\cdot w\\cdot b\\) for all \\(w\\in W^{i\\ast}\\)\n\nThe last result is a computation of the automorphism group of a noncommutative projective line. The automorphism group of \\(\\mathbb P_K(V)\\) is the set of \\(k\\)-linear shift-free equivalences \\(\\mathbb P_K(V)\\rightarrow\\mathbb P_K(V)\\) modulo natural equivalence.\n\nAlso, the author discuss some of the other notions of noncommutative projective line given in the literature. For some of these notions, the results in this article proves that a noncommutative projective line is a commutative curve of genus \\(0\\), and necessary and sufficient conditions for noncommutative curves of genus zero to be noncommutative projective lines are given. The theory presented in this article, just don't fit into other notions.\n\nAll necessary definitions and explicit computations are given in the text.

14466,"The author extends the notion and results of real places on fields to commutative rings.

Name: text, dtype: object","Let \\(k\\) be an arbitrary algebraically closed field. For any finite subgroup \\(G\\) of \\(\\text{SL}(3,k)\\) of order prime to the characteristic of the ground field \\(k\\) the quotient space \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k/G\\) is then a normal Gorenstein variety with trivial canonical sheaf. In birational geometry, a natural choice of a crepant smooth resolution of the singular variety \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k/G\\) would be very convenient, but it seems that the general theories in this framework, such as the theory of minimal models and the theory of torus embeddings, do not canonically provide a resolution of this type.\n\n In the paper under review, the author approaches this problem by studying a particular Hilbert scheme \\(\\text{Hilb}^G(\\mathbb{A}^3_k)\\), which finally turns out to be a canonical crepant resolution of the quotient variety \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k/G\\). The so-called \\(G\\)-orbit Hilbert scheme \\(\\text{Hilb}^G:= \\text{Hilb}^G(\\mathbb{A}^3_k)\\) is, by definition, the scheme parametrizing all \\(G\\)-invariant smoothable \\(0\\)-dimensional subschemes of \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k\\) of length \\(n:=|G|\\). This object, which may be regarded as a certain substitute for the quotient \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k/G\\) was introduced by the author and \\textit{Y. ItÃ´} in [Proc. Japan Acad., Ser. A 72, No. 7, 135--138 (1996; Zbl 0881.14002)] as a suitable tool in the study of resolutions of quotient singularities via the famous McKay correspondence.\n\nIn the present paper, the \\(G\\)-orbit Hilbert scheme \\(\\text{Hilb}^G\\) is described for a finite abelian subgroup \\(G\\) of \\(\\text{SL}(3,k)\\) resulting in the fact that \\(\\text{Hilb}^G\\) appears then as a smooth torus embedding associated to a crepant fan in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) with apices constructed from the group \\(G\\). Furthermore, it is shown that the commutativity of \\(G\\) implies the nonsingularity of that associated fan. \n\nThis finally establishes the author's main theorem (Theorem 0.1.) stating the following: For any abelian subgroup \\(G\\) of \\(\\text{SL}(3,k)\\) of order prime to the characteristic of the ground field \\(k\\) the \\(G\\)-orbit Hilbert scheme \\(\\text{Hilb}^G(\\mathbb{A}^3_k)\\) is a crepant resolution of the quotient space \\(\\mathbb{A}^3_k/G\\).\n\n The first half of the present article is devoted to describing a \\(G\\)-orbit Hilbert scheme as a toric variety in arbitrary dimension. This part is based on a fine analysis of the corresponding lattices and \\(G\\)-graphes, which is highly interesting and important for its own sake. In the second half of the paper, the particular case of dimension three and an abelian subgroup \\(G\\) of \\(\\text{SL}(3,k)\\) is inspected more closely by means of the special appearing \\(G\\)-graphs, culminating in the author's main theorem mentioned above. At the end of the article, the author discusses some interesting examples in dimension three and four, thereby illustrating the variety of possibilities that can occur already in those low-dimensional cases.\n\n In a sense, the present work may be regarded as a complement to the related earlier results by \\textit{Y.

Name: text, dtype: object","Nonlinear isomorphisms between Banach spaces have attracted much attention in the last twenty years. We recall that a map \(f\) between metric spaces \(M\) and \(N\) is said to be a coarse embedding if there exist positive functions \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\) such that \(\rho_1(d_M(x,y))\leq d_N(f(x), f(y))\leq \rho_2(d_M(x,y))\) for all \((x,y)\in M^2\) and, moreover, \(\rho_1(t)\) tends to \(+\infty\) when \(t\) increases to \(+\infty\). We say that \(f\) is a uniform embedding if \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) (defined on \(f(M)\)) are uniformly continuous. An embedding which is both coarse and uniform is called a strong uniform embedding. Previous work has almost completely cleared up, in the special case of \(l_p\) spaces, the conditions under which such embeddings could exist. The present article concludes this investigation, and considers as well the challenging case of Orlicz sequences spaces \(h_M\). It is shown, in particular, that the upper Matuszewska-Orlicz index \(\beta_M\) plays a central part. Theorem 3.1 improves on a previous work by \textit{P. W. Nowak} [Fundam. Math. 189, No. 2, 111--116 (2006; Zbl 1097.46052)] and shows that, if \(1\leq p\leq 2\), then \(l_2\) strongly uniform embeds into \(l_p\). The very interesting main results are in Section 4 and the following is shown (where \(M\) and \(N\) denote Orlicz functions):

 (1) If \(\beta_M < \beta_N\) or \(\beta_N \leq \beta_M < 2\) or \(\beta_N=\beta_M=\infty\), then \(h_M\) strongly uniform embeds into \(h_N\).

 (2) If \(\beta_M>2\) and \(\beta_N<\beta_M\), then \(h_M\) does not coarsely or uniformly embed into \(h_N\).

 (3) If \(\beta_N \leq 2\) and \(\beta_M=2\), then the coarse (uniform) embeddability of \(h_M\) into \(h_N\) is not determined by \(\beta_N\).

 Finally, the case where \(2<\beta_N=\beta_M<\infty\) remains unclear so far.",0

For example one obtains \n\\[\nK_1(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}\\cong \\bigoplus_p\\text{CH}^p(X,1) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}.\n\\]\n The groups CH\\(^p(X,n)\\) are called higher Chow groups. The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit way for constructing classes in CH\\(^2(X,1)\\) that are nontrivial modulo the image of the natural map \n\\[\n\\gamma: \\text{Pic} (X)\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^* \\to\\text{CH}^2(X,1)\n\\]\n and modulo torsion. We call such classes indecomposable. Cycles in CH\\(^2(X,1)\\) can be constructed by finding curves \\(Z_i\\) in \\(X\\) with rational functions \\(f_i\\) on them that satisfy \\(\\sum \\text{div} (f_i)=0\\) on \\(X\\). By general conjectures (see section 7), the cokernel of \\(\\gamma\\) is expected to be a countable group on any smooth surface. We will construct indecomposable elements in \\(CH^2(X,1)\\) on general quartic K3-surfaces that contain a line and on some special quintic surfaces of general type. Other examples over the complex numbers have been constructed by M. Nori on abelian surfaces, by A. Collino on Jacobian varieties, and by C. Voisin and C. Oliva on K3 surfaces. Our method consists of deforming the complex structure of the pair \\((X,Z)\\) and studying the variation of mixed Hodge structures associated to the open complements. The ideas of this technique in the case of ordinary Chow groups are similar to those developed earlier by \\textit{F. Bardelli} and \\textit{S. MÃ¼ller-Stach} (1991; unpublished) and by \\textit{C. Voisin} [Ann. Sci. Ã‰c. Norm. SupÃ©r., IV. SÃ©r. 27, No. 2, 209-226 (1994; Zbl 0808.14030)], but eventually go back to the fundamental idea of Griffiths to show the non-triviality of cohomology classes on the general member of a family of varieties by showing that their derivatives are non-zero. The advantage of our method is that it is not restricted to surfaces with trivial canonical bundle and that it is very simple to apply in situations where some geometry is known, in particular if an explicit family or a degeneration to a singular configuration can be written down.",1

14466,"The author extends the notion and results of real places on fields to commutative rings.

So the results of the paper are essentially not new but the expected extensions of the known ones for fields, or in some cases reformulations in the language of real places of some known facts for the real spectrum, as theorem 4.3. -- - Also the author raises the question of the possible extension of some of the results to the case of \\(k\\)-places with \\(k\\neq\\mathbb{R}\\).

Finally, the case of rank varieties of skewsymmetric tensors is studied.","The \\textit{rank} of a tensor \\(T\\) is a good measure for its complexity. This explains why a good deal of researches are devoted to methods for determining the rank of relevant tensors. If one accepts small perturbations of \\(T\\), the notion of rank turns into the notion of \\textit{border rank}, i.e. the generic rank in a neighbourhood of \\(T\\). Tensors whose border rank is bounded by \\(r\\) form an algebraic variety, the \\textit{\\(r\\)-secant variety} \\(\\sigma_r(X)\\) of the variety \\(X\\) of tensors of rank \\(1\\). Thus, one strategy to compute the border rank of a tensor \\(T\\) consists in determining defining equations for the varieties \\(\\sigma_r(X)\\) and test them on \\(T\\). Unfortunately, while we have many results on the dimension of secant varieties, very little is known about their defining equations, except for a small set of initial cases.\n\nThe author improves our knowledge on the defining equations, in the case of symmetric tensors. The variety \\(X_{n,d}\\) of rank \\(1\\) symmetric tensors \\(n\\times\\dots\\times n\\), \\(d\\)-times, corresponds to the variety of homogeneous polynomials of degree \\(d\\) in \\(n\\) variables which are power of linear forms. In geometric terms, \\(X_{n,d}\\) is a Veronese embedding of a linear space of dimension \\(n\\). It is well known that \\(X_{n,d}\\) is defined by quadratic equations, but the equations for its secant varieties can have much bigger degrees.\n\nThe author shows that, even if one lets \\(n,d\\) grow, there exists a constant \\(C(r)\\), which depends only on the rank \\(r\\), such that \\(\\sigma_r(X_{n,d})\\) is defined by equations of degree \\(\\leq C(r)\\). This is rather surprising, as \\(n,d\\) determine the dimension of the space where \\(X_{n,d}\\) lives. The proof is achieved by combining the various Veronese embeddings in a single algebraic structure, a Hopf ring, which is proved to have the required noetherianity properties.",1

1629356,"Summary: We classify completely the surfaces of general type whose canonical map is 3-to-1 onto a surface of minimal degree in projective space. These surfaces fall into 5 distinct classes and we give explicit examples belonging to each of these classes. As far as we know, one of the examples thus constructed was unknown and it is a surface whose canonical system has two infinitely near base points.","\\textit{R. Miranda} established [cf. Am. J.

Thus, he studies the ramification, branch locus, local structure of triple covers and the inseparable triple covers in the sections 5 and 6. - Finally in the section 7 and 8 he establishes the problem of lifting a triple cover in characteristic 3 to characteristic 0, and computes the invariants of triple covers of surfaces in the section 7 and 8.",1

1058016,"This is a very well written survey of the state-of-the-art of the mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in 1994. A postscript has been added summing up further developments until 1997. \n\n\nThe first chapter explains the origin and physical relevance of mirror symmetry in a very appealing way for mathematicians. It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\(A\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\(B\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\(A\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\(B\\)-model correlation functions, and \\(A\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \n\n\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\textit{B. R. Green} and \\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Those families \\(\\{M_t\\}\\) of varieties have an associated reflexive polyhedron in \\(L\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb R\\), where \\(L\\) is the real monomial lattice of the torus of which the toric variety is a compactification. The polar polyhedron is also reflexive and then determines a new family \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) of Calabi-Yau threefolds; the mirror conjecture in this case states that \\(\\{W_t\\}\\) is the dual mirror of \\(\\{M_t\\}\\). The third construction was done by \\textit{C. Borcea} [in ``Mirror symmetry. II'', AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math. 1, 717-743 (1997)] and \\textit{C. Voisin} [in: JournÃ©es de gÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique, Orsay 1992, AstÃ©risque 218, 273-323 (1993; Zbl 0818.14014)] and works for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from a K3 surface \\(S\\) with holomorphic involution \\(i\\) and an elliptic curve \\(A\\) by resolving singularities of \\(S\\times A/(i,j)\\), \\(j\\) being the involution on \\(A\\) defined by negation. \n\n\nThe author states two important conjectures regarding the mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry, the so-called ``Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry conjecture'' and ``Converse conjecture''. More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\n\n\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\n\n\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\textit{M. Kontsevich} and \\textit{Yu. Manin} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 3, 525-562 (1994; Zbl 0853.14020)].\n\n\nThe ``homological'' mirror conjecture, due to \\textit{M. Kontsevich} [in: Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 120-139 (1995; Zbl 0846.53021)] and \\textit{K. Fukaya} [in: Proc. GARC Workshop, Seoul Nat. Univ. 1993, Lect. Notes Ser., Seoul. 18, 1-102 (1993; Zbl 0853.57030)] involving the \\(A^\\infty\\)-categories of Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n\nThe mathematical proof of a certain number of striking enumerative predictions, for instance \\textit{A. B. Givental}'s proof [Sel. Math., New Ser. 1, No. 2, 325-345 (1995; Zbl 0920.14028), Proc. Int. Congr. Math., ZÃ¼rich 1994, Vol. 1, 472-480 (1995; Zbl 0863.14021) and Int. Math. Res. Not. 1996, No. 13, 613-663 (1996; Zbl 0881.55006)], that for complete intersection Calabi-Yau in projective spaces, the ``predicted'' enumerative formulas calculated with the Batyrev-Borisov candidate mirror dual are in fact correct evaluations of the Gromov-Witten invariants, thus proving all the enumerative predictions about the general quintic threefold made by \\textit{P. Candelas, E. Derrick} and \\textit{L. Parkes} [Nucl. Phys. B 407, No. 1, 115-154 (1993; Zbl 0899.32011)].\n\n\nThe new variants of string theory relevant to mirror symmetry. The more important are the so-called type \\(IIA\\) and type \\(IIB\\) string theories. The extra parameters that must be added to the conformal field theory moduli in each string theory are different and should be exchanged under mirror symmetry as shown by \\textit{P. S. Aspinwall} and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Phys. Lett. B 355, No. 1-2, 141-149 (1995)] and \\textit{D. R. Morrison} [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 46, 146-155 (1996)]. This is related to ``\\(D\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) dualities. \n\n\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\(T^3\\) fibration is interpreted as \\(T\\)-duality on the \\(T^3\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\(T^3\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\textit{M. Gross} and \\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\n\n\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0866.00043].","In this paper the retina R is modelled as a two-dimensional network \(\{0,1,...,n+1\}^ 2\) (and also as an integer interval \(\{0,1,...,N+1\})\). Each cell (i,j) is mainly related to a cortex cell \(x_{ij}\) to which a density of synaptic weights \(f_{ij}(x)\) is associated. It is assumed that \(f_{ij}(x)=f(\| x-x_{ij}\|)\) where f is decreasing, positive and \(f(0)=1\). It is assumed that the system is subject to stimulation chosen to render the resulting model Markovian in the one-dimensional case.


The convergence of the corresponding Markov chain to a stationary distribution is established which in turn establishes the retinotopy of the system. The difficulty in extending the results to the two- dimensional case is pointed out; in this case the asymptotic behaviour is brought out by Monte-Carlo simulation.",0

14466,"The author extends the notion and results of real places on fields to commutative rings.

If \\(k=\\mathbb{R}\\) the place is called real. The readers familiar with the notion of real spectra will surely have noticed the similarity of both constructions. Then the author considers the space \\(M(R)\\) of real places on \\(R\\) which is the collection of all the above pairs modulo some equivalence relation, and topologizes it with the quotient topology inherited by the canonical epimorphism \\(\\lambda:\\text{Spec}_ r(R)\\to M(R)\\).\n\n\nThis space \\(M(R)\\) was well known in case \\(R\\) is a field, and its properties extend naturally (and easily) to this more general situation, as well as other concepts as the one of holomorphy ring. So the results of the paper are essentially not new but the expected extensions of the known ones for fields, or in some cases reformulations in the language of real places of some known facts for the real spectrum, as theorem 4.3. -- - Also the author raises the question of the possible extension of some of the results to the case of \\(k\\)-places with \\(k\\neq\\mathbb{R}\\). Some work in this direction (always in the case of a field) was done by \\textit{H.-W. SchÃ¼lting} in GÃ©omÃ©trie algÃ©brique rÃ©elle et formes quadratiques, JournÃ©e SMF, Univ. Rennes 1981, Lect. Notes Math. 959, 433-442 (1982; Zbl 0498.14013), where he works with the relative holomorphy ring. Finally the paper finishes by applying the results to the particular case of rings with many units and answering in the affirmative a question of \\textit{M. Knebusch}, namely whether the space \\(M_ T\\) of real places compatible with a given preorder \\(T\\) is Hausdorff.","In the monograph [\\textit{M. Knebusch} and \\textit{D. Zhang}, Manis valuations and PrÃ¼fer extensions. I: A new chapter in commutative algebra. Lect. Notes Math. 1791 (2002; Zbl 1033.13001)] the authors developed a theory of Manis valuations on rings and PrÃ¼fer extensions. In the present paper they study these notions in the context of real algebra, i.e., in the presence of some form of order structure (preorderings, partial orderings, total orders,\\dots). Convex subrings of totally ordered fields are well known to be valuation rings. Therefore valuations arise naturally in the theory of ordered rings, in particular in connection with convexity. (A subset \\(M\\) of a preordered ring \\((A,A^+)\\) is convex if \\(a, b\\in M\\) and \\(c- a, b- c\\in A^+\\) implies \\(c\\in M\\).)\n\nThroughout, the paper is concerned with convexity and its relationship with valuations. Ordered rings and convex subrings lead to examples of PrÃ¼fer extensions and PrÃ¼fer closed rings. In the other direction, PrÃ¼fer theory is a powerful tool in the study of convex subrings\n\nThe notion of a convex valuation on a ring generalizes the classical concept of compatibility of a valuation on a field with a total order. In most cases this means that the corresponding valuation ring is convex. These are the valuations that are useful in the study of ordered rings. The relationship between intersections of convex valuation rings, notably holomorphy rings, and convex subrings is one main topic. These concepts are studied quite generally in the beginning. The most substantial results are obtained with additional assumptions about the order (such as bounded inversion: \\(1+ A^+\\subseteq A^\\times\\)), or about the ring (e.g., \\((A, A^+)\\) is an \\(f\\)-ring), or both. If bounded inversion holds then: \\(A\\) is a PrÃ¼fer extension of every convex subring, say \\(B\\); every intermediate ring of \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) is convex in \\(A\\) as well and is a ring of quotients of \\(B\\). Even without bounded inversion it is shown that for any PrÃ¼fer subring \\(B\\subseteq A\\) there is a largest intermediate ring that contains \\(B\\) as a convex subring. Stronger versions of these results hold for \\(f\\)-rings. The results are applied to rings of continuous functions; it is shown that rings of continuous functions on metric spaces are PrÃ¼fer closed. Finally, valuations on \\(f\\)-rings are studied.",1

An \(n\)-dimensional submanifold \(\Lambda\subset (Y,\lambda)\) which is tangent to \(\ker\lambda\) is called a Legendrian submanifold. A \(2n\)-dimensional manifold \(X\) together with a closed non-degenerate two-form \(\omega\) is a symplectic manifold. \((X,\omega)\) is exact if \(\omega=d\alpha\) is exact. A properly embedded Lagrangian submanifold without boundary \(L_{\Lambda,\varnothing}\subset(\mathbb R\times Y,d(e^t\lambda))\) of the symplectization of \((Y,\lambda)\) satisfying the property that \(L_{\Lambda,\varnothing}\) coincides with the cylinder \((-\infty, N)\times\Lambda\) outside of a compact set, is called Lagrangian cap of a Legendrian submanifold \(\Lambda\subset (Y,\lambda)\). A properly embedded Lagrangian submanifold without boundary \(L_{\varnothing,\Lambda}\subset(X,d\alpha)\) that coincides with the cylinder \((N,\infty)\times\Lambda\subset[0,\infty)\times Y\) outside of a compact set, is called Lagrangian filling of a Legendrian submanifold \(\Lambda\subset (Y,\lambda)\). The concatenation of \(L_{\varnothing,\Lambda}\) and \(L_{\Lambda,\varnothing}\) is the closed Lagrangian submanifold \(L=(L_{\varnothing,\Lambda}\cap\{(t,x);\;t\leq N\})\cup(L_{\Lambda,\varnothing}\cap\{(t,x);\;t\geq N\})\subset(X, d\alpha)\). A Lagrangian immersion \(L\subset(X,\omega)\) is called displaceable if there exists a time-dependent Hamiltonian on \(X\) whose induced Hamiltonian flow \(\varphi^s: X\to X\) satisfies \(L\cap\varphi^1(L)=\varnothing\). The number \(w(L,X)=\sup\{\pi r^2\in[0,\infty);\;\mathcal{B}(X,L,r)\neq\varnothing\}\) is called the Gromov width of a Lagrangian submanifold \(L\subset(X,\omega)\), where \(\mathcal{B}(X,L,r)\) is the set of symplectic embeddings of \(B^{2n}(r)\) into \((X,\omega)\). A Lagrangian immersion \(L\subset(X,\omega)\) whose self-intersections consist of transverse double-points is said to be uniruled if there is some \(A>0\) for which, for any compatible almost complex structure \(J\) on \(X\) and a point \(x\in L\), there exists a non-constant \(J\)-holomorphic disc in \(X\) having boundary on \(L\), having a boundary point mapping to \(x\), and whose \(\omega\)-area is at most \(A\).

In this paper, the author shows that these submanifolds are non-uniruled and have infinite Gromov width. Also, it is proven that if \(L\subset(X,d\alpha)\), where \(\alpha\) is a primitive of symplectic form, is a displaceable exact Lagrangian immersion of a closed manifold obtained as the concatenation of an immersed exact Lagrangian filling and an embedded exact Lagrangian cap, then the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra of \(L\) is acyclic even when using Novikov coefficients. Finally, the author considers a displaceable exact Lagrangian immersion \(L\subset(X,d\alpha)\) of a closed manifold with the assumption that \(L\) is a spin manifold with fixed choice of a spin structure. It is shown that if the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra with coefficients in a unital ring \(R\) of the Legendrian lift of \(L\) is not acyclic, with or without Novikov coefficients, then for any \(J\in \mathcal{J}_L\) and \(x\in L\) there exists a \(J\)-holomorphic disc in \(X\) having boundary on \(L\), one positive boundary puncture, possibly several negative boundary punctures, and a boundary-point passing through \(x\), where \(\mathcal{J}_L\) is the set of compatible almost complex structures on \((X,d\alpha)\).",0

The optimal control of chemical processes under the coexistence of inequality constraints on input and state is challenging, especially when the process model is only partially known. The objective of this paper is to design an applicable optimal control for chemical processes with known model structure and unknown model parameters. To eliminate the barriers caused by the hybrid constraints and unknown model parameters, the inequality state constraints are first transformed into equality state constraints by using the slack function method. Then, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with nonquadratic performance integrand is adopted to handle the augmented system with input constraints. The proposed approach requires only partial knowledge of the system, i.e., the model structure. The value information of the model parameters is not required. The feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are tested using two nonlinear cases including a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) example.",0

While each curve of the first type is defined by a polynomial invariant under complex conjugation \\((x,y)\\mapsto(\\overline{x},\\overline{y}),\\) that is, a polynomial with real coefficients, for curves of the second type the author prefers to use polynomials invariant under another antianalytic involution, namely \\((x,y)\\mapsto(-1/\\overline{x},\\overline{y}/\\overline{x}^{g+1}),\\) where \\(g\\) is the genus of the curve. Using these descriptions the main result follows: necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of an isomorphism between two hyperelliptic real algebraic curves. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the existence of an automorphism of \\(\\widehat{\\mathbb C}\\) with real coefficients which maps \\(B_X\\) onto \\(B_Y\\) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for two curves \\((X,\\sigma)\\) and \\((Y,\\sigma)\\) defined by polynomials with real coefficients to be (real) isomorphic.

1566951,"Let \\(k\\) be a field, and let \\(E\\) be a free \\(k\\)-bimodule, or in other words, a two-sided \\(k\\)-vector space. The author introduces a concept of admissible two-sided \\(k\\)-vector spaces and defines for such a space a noncommutative analog of the symmetric algebra. Then he computes the skew fields of fractions for some classes of admissible two-sided vector spaces. The components of degree zero of these skew fields can be considered as function fields of noncommutative ruled surfaces (cf. [\\textit{M. Artin, M. Van den Bergh}, J. Algebra 133, No. 2, 249-271 (1990; Zbl 0717.14001)]). As an application a clear description of the birational equivalence classes of certain types of such surfaces is obtained.","In this interesting paper the authors investigate two-sided vector spaces over a perfect field \\(K\\), i.e., an abelian group \\(V\\) equipped with both left and right action by \\(K\\), subject to the associativity condition \\((xv)y=x(vy)\\) for all \\(x,y\\in K\\), \\(v\\in V\\). In the case when left and right actions of \\(K\\) on \\(V\\) agree, then \\(V\\) is nothing more than an ordinary \\(K\\)-vector space. Among the obtained results there is a complete characterization of isomorphism classes for simple two-sided \\(K\\)-vector spaces, which are left finite dimensional. This characterization allows authors to obtain the explicit description for the Quillen \\(K\\)-groups in the category of two-sided \\(K\\)-vector spaces which are left finite dimensional. Finally, a closely related problem of describing homomorphisms \\(\\varphi: K\\to M_n(K)\\) is investigated. A number of examples which illustrate the above results is presented.",1
