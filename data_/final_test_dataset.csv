The main conjecture concerning \\(H_{d,g}\\) asserts its connectedness. It has been proved, by several authors, for \\(g\\geq (d-3)(d-4)/2-1\\) by deforming curves to curves of degree \\(d\\) containing a plane curve of degree \\(d-1\\) as a subscheme (so called ``extremal curves''). On the other hand, \\textit{S. Nollet} [Ann. Sci. Ã‰c. Norm. SupÃ©r., IV Ser. 30, No. 3, 367--384 (1997; Zbl 0892.14004)] described the irreducible components of the schemes \\(H_{3,g}\\) and proved that all these schemes are connected.\n\nIn these paper, the authors do the same thing for the schemes \\(H_{4,g}\\). The idea is the following one: a non-reduced component of a (locally Cohen-Macaulay) space curve of degree 4 must be a double line or conic, or a triple line, or a quadruple line. Double structures on smooth space curves were described in an important paper of \\textit{D. Ferrand} [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 281, 345--347 (1975; Zbl 0315.14019)] and triple structures on space lines by \\textit{R. Hartshorne} [Math. Ann. 238, 229--280 (1978; Zbl 0411.14002)]. Quadruple structures on space lines can be described using the general results of \\textit{C. BÄƒnicÄƒ} and \\textit{O. Forster} [in: Algebraic geometry, Proc. Lefschetz Centen.

In order to prove the connectedness of \\(H_{4,g}\\) they show that, for \\(g\\leq -3\\), thick 4-lines form an irreducible component \\(G_4\\) of \\(H_{4,g}\\), disjoint from the component \\(E\\) of extremal curves, that any other component can be connected to either \\(E\\) or \\(G_4\\) and that there exists a component meeting both \\(E\\) and \\(G_4\\).",1

The key point is that if we fix an excessive measure m, then any excessive measure absolutely continuous with respect to m admits a Radon-Nikodým derivative that is finely continuous off a suitable exceptional set. The domination principle is the statement that if the density of the potential of a measure \(\mu\) is dominated by the density of a second excessive measure \(\eta\), almost everywhere with respect to \(\mu\), then the potential of \(\mu\) is everywhere dominated by \(\eta\). This result sharpens earlier work of \textit{G. Mokobodzki} and the first named author, and it is related to the co- fine domination principle of K. Janssen. The principal tools used are the theory of Kuznetsov measures, and the ``essential limits'' pioneered by Chung and Walsh. Several applications of the domination principle are made. In particular we characterize the class of m-quasi-bounded potentials, extending work of Arsove and Leutwiler in Newtonian potential theory.",0

Einer Biegungsfläche eines orthogonalen einschaligen Hyperboloids läßt sich stets eine Gruppe von vier Flächen \(H\), \(H^\prime\), \(\overline H\), \(\overline{H^\prime}\) zuordnen, deren Krümmungslinien den Asymptotenlinien der Biegungsfläche entsprechen, und deren Hauptkrümmungsradien \(r\), \(r^\prime\); \ \(r^\prime, r\); \ \(\frac{1}{r^\prime}, \frac{1}{r}\); \(\frac{1}{r}, \frac{1}{r^\prime}\) sind.

Mit jedem einzelnen Flächenpunkt ist eine Dupinsche Zyklide verbunden, die das Element der geometrischen Konstruktion bildet.

Schließlich wird die Frage nach der allgemeinsten Form des Linienelementes einer Fläche aufgeworfen, die folgenden Bedingungen genügt: mit den Flächenelementen soll sich ein System von \(\infty^2\) Richtungen derart koppeln lassen, daß diese bei beliebigen Verbiegungen stets die Asymptotenlinien der Biegungsfläche in ein orthogonales Kurvennetz auf einer festen Kugel abbilden. Als Lösung ergeben sich die Flächen \(z = \mathfrak R \{f(x + iy)\}\).",0

In contrast to the general approach established by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [Int. J. Math. 6, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004); J. Algebr.

We discuss some general properties of this moduli space by studying it in the framework of Huybrechts-Lehn theory of framed modules. We classify the fixed points under a toric action on the moduli space, and use this to compute the PoincarÃ© polynomial of the latter. This will imply that the moduli spaces we are considering are irreducible. We also consider fractional first Chern classes, which means that we are extending our computation to a stacky deformation of a Hirzebruch surface. From the physical viewpoint, our results provide the mathematical framework for the counting of D4-D2-D0 branes bound states on total spaces of the bundles \\({\\mathcal O}_{\\mathbb P^1}(-p)\\).",1
1144539,Summary: We present an algorithm for obtaining the matter content of effective six-dimensional theories resulting from compactification of \\(F\\)-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds which are hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The algorithm allows us to read off the matter content of the theory from the polyhedron describing the Calabi-Yau manifold. This is based on the generalized Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation condition.,"Two families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds are called mirror dual, if the assigned conformal field theories are isomorphic. This would imply a certain behavior of the Hodge numbers: If \\(V, V'\\) are representatives from both families, then \\(h^{11} (V) = h^{21} (V')\\) and \\(h^{21} (V) = h^{11} (V')\\). (For the remaining Hodge numbers there is no freedom anyway.) Moreover, the number of rational curves with a fixed degree on \\(V\\) can then be obtained by regarding the Picard-Fuchs equation on \\(V'\\). Before the paper under review appeared, some pairs of mirror dual families (in the weaker sense regarding the Hodge numbers only) were known by physicists. These families appeared as hypersurfaces in certain 4-dimensional, weighted projective spaces. However, it turned out that some of those CY-hypersurfaces did not have a mirror partner at all. \n\n\nThe author has generalized the weighted projective approach by regarding hypersurfaces (and in subsequent papers even complete intersections) in projective toric varieties. Then, mirror duality (again in the sense of having equations between Hodge numbers) is provided by duality or polarity (i.e. interchanging the role of facets and vertices) of polytopes.\n\n\nThe paper begins with an introduction to the subject of projective toric varieties (given by some lattice polytope \\(\\Delta)\\). Regarding Laurent polynomials with \\(\\Delta\\) as its Newton polyhedron, one obtains the families of hypersurfaces we want to deal with. Using an approach of Danilov and Khovanskij, it is possible to compute the Hodge numbers of the crepant resolutions of these hypersurfaces. -- On the other hand, the author introduces the class of so-called reflexive polyhedra (admitting just one interior lattice point \\(P\\), and the facets of \\(\\Delta\\) have to have lattice distance 1 of \\(P)\\). It turns out that this class is invariant under duality (polarity) of polytopes; and it is exactly these polytopes that provide Calabi-Yau manifolds as hypersurfaces.\n\n\nThe paper closes with regarding as an example the family of hypersurfaces of degree 5 in the not even weighted \\(\\mathbb{P}^4\\).

Presently the moduli of these elliptic \\(K3\\) surfaces are considered, and the main result computes the number of connected components of each moduli space.\n\nThe overall approach consists of the moduli theory of lattice polarized \\(K3\\) surfaces. Here the ADE-types of the reducible fibres give a natural sublattice \\[ L = U\\oplus R \\] of the NÃ©ron-Severi lattice of the \\(K3\\) surface where the hyperbolic plane \\(U\\) is generated by the zero section and a fibre and the orthogonal summand \\(R\\) corresponds to the ADE-types (following Kodaira). Note that \\(L\\) need not embed primitively into the NÃ©ron-Severi lattice; in fact, the non-primitivity is exactly accounted for by the torsion sections. Thus the primitive closure \\(L'\\) is the generic NÃ©ron-Severi lattice on each moduli component (of dimension \\(20-\\operatorname{rank}(L)\\)).\n\nThe author's involved calculations are based on lattice theoretic methods pioneered by Miranda and Morrison in a mostly unpublished manuscript (available electronically). Using these techniques, the author manages to detect precisely which components can be algebraically distinguished, i.e. where the given torsion sections can be configured in different ways to meet the reducible fibres. The classification result of the paper goes as follows:\n\nThere are exactly 196 combinatorial types of complex elliptic \\(K3\\) surfaces with more than one connected moduli component.\n\nInteresting enough, almost half of them (namely 89) comprise extremal elliptic \\(K3\\) surfaces (i.e. those with maximal Picard number \\(\\rho=20\\), yet finite Mordell-Weil group). Here the results can often be explained through the transcendental lattice (as computed in [\\textit{I. Shimada} and \\textit{D.-Q. Zhang}, Nagoya Math. J. 161, 23--54 (2001; Zbl 1064.14503)]), or through the fields of definition. Among the 107 non-extremal types, 95 have algebraic distinguishable moduli components; for the remaining 12 types, the computations reveal that there are two complex conjugate moduli components.",1
1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","A general method for producing various effective Null- and PostivstellensÃ¤tze in algebraically closed valued fields and ordered groups is provided and some implications on geometric conditions are drawn, giving some new constructive versions of classical algebraic results based on Zorn's lemma.

When \\(C_q\\) is normal in \\(\\text{Aut}_{\\overline{k}}(X)\\), the strategy is to look at the reduced automorphism group \\(\\text{Aut}_{\\overline{k}}(X)/C_q\\), which is a finite subgroup of \\(PGL(2, \\overline{k})\\). In the Artin-Schreier case (\\(q=p\\)), the Galois group \\(C_q\\) is normal in \\(\\text{Aut}_{\\overline{k}}(X)\\) except in three exceptional cases dealt with in Theorem 1.1(2). In the Kummer case (\\(q\\neq p\\)), in order to ensure the normality of \\(C_q\\), the author restricts to \\textit{strongly branched} covers, i.e. those with at least \\(2q+1\\) branch points. Using the classification of finite subgroups of \\(PGL(2,\\overline{k})\\) as in Huggins' paper cited above, the author shows that \\(X\\) is defined over its field of moduli if the reduced automorphism group is not cyclic of order prime to \\(p\\) (Theorem 1.1(1)).\n\nA key ingredient in the argument is Proposition 4.1, which asserts that under certain conditions the rational subfield \\(\\overline{k}(x)\\subset \\overline{k}(X)\\) corresponding to the \\(q\\)-cyclic cover \\(X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1_{\\overline{k}}\\) is the unique rational subfield \\(\\overline{k}(t)\\subset \\overline{k}(X)\\) with the property that \\(\\overline{k}(X)|\\overline{k}(t)\\) is a \\(q\\)-cyclic Galois extension. Unfortunately, the proof of this result in the strongly branched Kummer case is incomplete -- the argument doesn't reach a contradiction as announced. However, the proof can be completed as follows: using the notation of Proposition 4.1, a simple argument shows that the \\(2q\\) places \\(Q_{i,\\nu}\\) are in fact the \\textit{only} ramified places in the extension \\(F|F_0\\). But this contradicts the assumption that \\(F|F_0\\) is strongly branched.\n\nPart (3) of Theorem 1.1 addresses the case of Artin-Schreier covers with reduced automorphism group cyclic of order prime to \\(p\\), stating that under certain group-theoretic assumptions, \\(X\\) can be defined over its field of moduli.

One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S. Abhyankar} and \\textit{T.-T. Moh}, J. Reine Angew. Math. 276, 148-166 (1975; Zbl 0332.14004) and \\textit{M. Suzuki}, J. Math. Soc. Japan 26, 241-257 (1974; Zbl 0276.14001)]. \\textit{V.

While the proof is done for polynomials over the complex numbers, the method applies to any algebraically closed field.","\textbf{I.} Von \textit{Paley} und \textit{Wiener} (Fouriertransforms in the complex domain (1934; F. d. M. \(60_{\text{I}}\), 345), S. 12-13) stammt der Satz:

Damit eine in \((-\infty,\infty)\) quadratisch \(L\)-integrable Funktion \(F (x)\) eine \textit{Fourier}-Transformierte \(\varPhi(y)\) hat, die außerhalb eines Intervalls verschwindet, ist notwendig und hinreichend, daß \(F\) mit einer ganzen Funktion vom Exponentialtypus äquivalent ist. -- Dieser Satz wird auf Funktionen \(F\) von \(n\) Variablen verallgemeinert. Weiterhin wird er folgendermaßen präzisiert:

\(n\) reelle Zahlen \(\lambda_1,\,\ldots,\, \lambda_n\) mit der Eigenschaft \(\lambda_1^2+\cdots + \lambda_n^2 = 1\) heißen eine Richtung \(\lambda\). Es sei \(h (\lambda)\) die obere Grenze von
\[
 \varlimsup_{r\to\infty} r^{-1} \log \bigl| F (\alpha_1 - i\lambda_1r,\ldots, \alpha_n-i\lambda_n r) \bigr|,
\]
 wenn die \(\alpha\) zwischen \(-\infty\) und \(\infty\) variieren. Ferner sei \(\mathfrak K\) die konvexe Hülle des Gebietes, außerhalb dessen die \textit{Fourier}-Transformierte \(\varPhi (y_1,\ldots, y_n)\) von \(F\) verschwindet. \(\chi(\lambda)\) sei die Stützfunktion von \(\mathfrak K\) bezüglich \(O\). Ist dann \(F\) eine ganze Funktion vom Exponentialtypus, die quadratisch in \((-\infty,\infty)\) integrabel ist, so gilt: \(h (\lambda) = \chi(\lambda)\).

Aus diesen Sätzen wird eine Reihe von Folgerungen gezogen.

\textbf{II.} Zunächst werden aus den Sätzen des ersten Teils einige Folgerungen gezogen, von denen eine angeführt sei:

Wenn es zu einer ganzen Funktion \(F (z_1,\ldots, z_n)\) vier positive Konstanten \(a\), \(A\), \(c\), \(C\) gibt, so daß für alle reellen \(x_1,\ldots,\, x_n\)
\[
 |F(x_1,\ldots,x_n)|<Ae^{-a(|x_1|+\cdots+|x_n|)}
\]
 und für alle komplexen \(z_1,\,\ldots, z_n\)
\[
 |F(z_1,\ldots,z_n)|<Ce^{c(|z_1|+\cdots+|z_n|)}
\]
 ist, so ist \(F\) identisch 0.

Der Hauptzweck der Arbeit ist der Beweis zweier Sätze für Funktionen von \(n\) Variablen, deren Spezialfälle für \(n = 1\) folgendermaßen lauten:

Satz III. \(F (z)\) sei eine ganze Funktion vom Exponentialtyp, die der Bedingung
\[
 \varlimsup_{r\to\infty} r^{-1} \log \bigl(| F (-ir)| + |F (ir) |\bigr)<\pi
\]
 genügt. Dann sind bei \(p > 0\) das Integral
\[
 \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty |F(x)|^p\,dx
\]
 und die Reihe
\[
 \cdots +|F(-m)|^p + \cdots+ |F(-1)|^p + |F(0)|^p + |F(1)|^p+ \cdots + |F(m)|^p +\cdots
\]
 gleichzeitig konvergent in dem Sinne, daß die Konvergenz des einen die Konvergenz des anderen nach sich zieht.

Satz IV. Damit eine ganze Funktion \(F (z)\) vom Exponentialtyp sei und die beiden Eigenschaften:
\[
 \begin{gathered} \varlimsup r^{-1} \log \bigl(| F(- ir) | + | F (ir) |\bigr)\leqq\pi, \\ \text{Existenz von}\quad \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} |F(x) |^p\,dx\quad \text{für ein }p > 1 \end{gathered}
\]
 besitze, ist notwendig und hinreichend, daß sie in der Form
\[
 F(z) = \int\limits_{-\pi}^\pi \bigl[(1 - z) \varPsi (\pi) + z\varPsi(y)\bigr] e^{izy}\,dy
\]
 dargestellt werden kann, wo \(\varPsi(y)\) eine stetige Funktion der Periode \(2\pi\) bedeutet, deren \textit{Fourier}reihe \(\sum\limits_{-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{-iny} \sim \varPsi(y)\) die Eigenschaft hat, daß
\[
 \sum_{-\infty}^\infty |nc_n|^p
\]
 konvergiert.

Die Sätze werden erst für \(n = 1\) bewiesen und dann durch vollständige Induktion auf beliebiges \(n\) übertragen. An Nebenresultaten ist bemerkenswert die Herstellung von ganzen Funktionen vom Exponentialtyp und von der Klasse \(L^p\) (\(p > 2\)), die keine \textit{Fourier}-Transformierte besitzen.

Zum Schluß wird der im Referat über den ersten Teil erwähnte Satz über den Zusammenhang von \(h(\lambda)\) und \(\chi(\lambda)\) auf den Fall erweitert, daß \(F(z_1,\ldots,z_n)\) nicht in zweiter, sondern in \(p\)-ter Potenz (\(p > 0\)) integrabel ist.",0

Moret-Bailly} [Ann. Sci. Ã‰c. Norm. SupÃ©r., IV. SÃ©r. 22, No. 2, 161-179 (1989; Zbl 0704.14014)], see also \\textit{R. S. Rumely}, J. Reine Angew. Math. 368, 127-133 (1986; Zbl 0581.14014).","Let \\(A\\) be an abelian variety defined over a number field \\(K\\) that admits complex multiplication by another number field \\(L\\). Let \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\) be a prime of \\(K\\), above a rational prime \\(p\\) say, at which \\(A\\) has good reduction \\(A / \\mathfrak{p}\\). If \\(A = E\\) is an elliptic curve, then either the torsion group scheme \\((E / \\mathfrak{p}) [p]\\) is of order \\(p\\) or it is trivial. In the former case, \\(E\\) is said to have \\textit{ordinary reduction} at \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\), and the endomorphism algebra of \\(E / \\mathfrak{p}\\) is still isomorphic to \\(L\\). In the latter, \\(E\\) is said to have \\textit{supersingular reduction} at \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\), and the endomorphism algebra of \\(E / \\mathfrak{p}\\) is then a rational quaternion algebra. In a classical work, \\textit{M. Deuring} [Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hamb. 14, 197--272 (1941; Zbl 0025.02003)] has given a simple criterion to tell which possibility occurs, purely in terms of the field \\(L\\) and the rational prime \\(p\\) determined by \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\); the reduction of \\(E\\) is ordinary at \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\) if and only if \\(p\\) splits in the imaginary quadratic field \\(L\\) (and supersingular otherwise).\n\nThe author gives a similar criterion for abelian varieties of arbitrary dimension. Here there is no full dichotomy between ordinary and supersingular. Instead, one considers the (appropriately normalized) Newton polygon of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism acting on an \\(\\ell\\)-adic Tate module of the reduction \\(A / \\mathfrak{p}\\). This time the reduction of the abelian variety \\(A\\) at \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\) is called \\textit{ordinary} if the slopes of this polygon are all either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), and \\textit{supersingular} if all these slopes are \\(1/2\\). The author gives a very clean and general description of these slopes purely in terms of the CM type of \\(A\\) and the cardinality of certain double cosets in the Galois group of (the Galois closure of) \\(L\\) determined by the prime \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\) of \\(K\\) and this CM type. The proof of these results uses the Shimura-Taniyama formula for \\(p\\)-divisible groups [\\textit{J. Tate}, SÃ©min. Bourbaki 1968/69, No. 352, 95--110 (1971; Zbl 0212.25702)].\n\nSome corollaries of this main result are the following.\n\n(1) Let \\(L^+\\) be the maximal totally real subfield of \\(L\\). For \\(A\\) to have ordinary reduction at \\(\\mathfrak{p}\\) we must have that all primes \\(\\mathfrak{q}^+\\) of \\(L^+\\) above \\(p\\) are split in the quadratic extension \\(L\\). For the reduction of \\(A\\) to be supersingular we must have that \\(\\mathfrak{q}^+\\) is either inert or ramified in \\(L\\) for all those \\(\\mathfrak{q}^+\\) whose ramification index and residue degree are both odd. These necessary conditions are in general not sufficient any longer.\n\n(2) Similarly, it is no longer true in general that \\(A\\) is supersingular if and only if all primes of \\(L^+\\) of \\(L\\) above \\(p\\) are either inert or ramified in \\(L\\). However, the author shows that this conclusion does still hold if \\(A\\) is of odd dimension and \\(L^+\\) is Galois over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). If these additional hypotheses are not verified, or when looking for ordinary abelian varieties, sufficient and necessary conditions such as these will not be as simple, as they will involve the CM type of \\(A\\).",1

1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group.

We prove that each root of \\(X\\) with respect to \\(T\\) can be obtained by restriction of some root of \\(X\\) with respect to \\(\\mathbb T\\). This allows to give an elementary proof of the description of roots of the affine Cremona group. Several results on restriction of roots in the case of a subtorus action on an affine toric variety are obtained.,"For \(f \in L^1 (\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{C}),\) the Fourier transform of \(f\) is defined by

It is called \textit{logarithmic translation covariant} if \(z(f(\cdot -t))(x)=e^{-it\cdot x} z(f)(x),\) for every \(f \in L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{C}),\ x, t \in \mathbb{R}^n.\) It is called a \textit{valuation} if \(z(f \vee g)+z(f \wedge g)=z(f)+z(g)\) for all \(f, g \in L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{C}),\) where \(f \vee g\) denotes the pointwise maximum of \(f\) and \(g\) taken for the real and imaginary parts separately, and \(f \wedge g\) denotes the corresponding minimum of \(f\) and \(g\).

In the paper under review the authors prove that the Fourier transform is a continuous, positively \(\mathrm{GL}(n)\) covariant and logarithmic translation covariant valuation. Moreover, the Fourier transform is only such a valuation on the complex valued functions.",0

In a recent paper [Sel. Math., New Ser. 4, 419-445 (1998; Zbl 0915.14010)], \\textit{A. A. Klyachko} observed that a solution to this problem is given by an application of Mumford's criterion in geometric invariant theory [see also the expository paper by \\textit{W. Fulton} in AstÃ©risque 252, SÃ©min. Bourbaki 1997/98, Exp. No. 845, 255-269 (1998; Zbl 0929.15006)]. The eigenvalue inequalities are derived from products in Schubert calculus. In particular, Weyl's inequalities correspond to Schubert calculus in projective space. The necessity of these conditions is due to \\textit{U. Helmke} and \\textit{J. Rosenthal} [Math. Nachr. 171, 207-225 (1995; Zbl 0815.15012)]. \n\n\nOne of the fascinating points about the above problem is that there are several equivalent formulations noted by Klyachko. For instance, the problem is related to the following question in representation theory: Given a collection of irreducible representations of \\(\\text{SU}(n)\\), which irreducibles appear in the tensor product? A second equivalent problem involves toric vector bundles over the complex projective plane. \n\n\nIn this paper we investigate the corresponding problem for products of unitary matrices. This question also has a relationship with a representation-theoretic problem, that of the decomposition of the fusion product of representations [see \\textit{A. Knutson} and \\textit{T. C. Tao}, J. Am. Math. Soc. 12, 1055-1090 (1999; Zbl 0944.05097)]. The solution to the multiplicative problem is also derived from geometric invariant theory, namely from the Mehta-Seshadri theory of parabolic bundles over the projective line. The main result of this paper shows that the eigenvalue inequalities are derived from products in quantum Schubert calculus. This improves a result of \\textit{I. Biswas} [Asian J. Math. 3, 333-344 (1999; Zbl 0982.14022)], who gave the first description of these inequalities. A similar result has been obtained independently by \\textit{P. Belkale} [Compos. Math. 129, 67-86 (2001; Zbl 1042.14031)]. \n\n\nThe proof is an application of the Mehta-Seshadri theorem. A set of unitary matrices \\(A_1,\\dots, A_l\\) such that each \\(A_i\\) lies in a conjugacy class \\(C_i\\) and such that their product is the identity is equivalent to a unitary representation of the fundamental group of the \\(l\\) times punctured sphere, with each generator \\(\\gamma_i\\) being mapped to the conjugacy class \\(C_i\\). By the Mehta-Seshadri theorem such a representation exists if and only if there exists a semi-stable parabolic bundle on \\(\\mathbb{P}^1\\) with \\(l\\) parabolic points whose parabolic weights come from the choice of conjugacy classes \\(C_i\\). This last interpretation of the original eigenvalue problem can be related to the Gromov-Witten invariants of the Grassmannian and is done in this paper. \n\n\nMoreover, we investigate how factorization and hidden symmetries of these Gromov-Witten invariants relate to the multiplicative eigenvalue problem. \n\n\nFinally we explain the representation-theoretic interpretation of \\(\\Delta_q(l)\\) in terms of the Verlinde algebra of \\(\\text{SU}(n)\\).",1

VII.) gegebene Definition der Null, welche als schwer verständlich angegriffen worden war, und bezieht sich namentlich auf ein Beispiel, welches Worpitzky in seiner Replik zur Erläuterung der Definition giebt, worin bei Addition einer Strecke zu einem Flächenstück erstere, sofern die Addition die Grösse nicht verändert, als Null auftritt, obwohl sie eine Grösse ist. Diekmann führt aus, dass die Erläuterung grade auf die falsche Deutung hinführt, während die Definition selbst den richtigen Sinn wenigstens zulässt: die Strecke ist nicht null als Linearquantum, sondern als Nicht-Fläche. Wenn Worpitzky die Null ein Ding nennt, so kann und muss man von den Bestimmungen dieses Dinges abstrahiren; wenn er aber die Existenz des Dinges Null durch dessen extensive Eigenschaft nachweist, so hebt er selbst die einzig mögliche Rechtfertigung auf. Im weiteren findet man jedoch Grund, die Beachtung des Umstandes sehr zu vermissen, dass die blosse Hinterstellung der Bedingung, die Null solle durch Addition keine Grösse ändern, ohne Erklärung, wodurch sie realisirt wird, der Theorie nicht genügen kann. Was die Null sei, bleibt unerklärt. Sie ist ein eigeführtes Rechnungselement; die Theorie bleibt die Rechtfertigung der Einführung schuldig; sie erfüllt diese Forderung und beweist zugleich deren Nothwendigkeit durch die sich ergebenden Grenzen und Ausnahmen der Rechnung mit Null. Diekmann will dagegen wie mit der Null auch mit dem Symbol \({ a \over 0 }\) verfahren, und dasselbe durch die Bedingung definiren, dass es bei Addition nicht geändert wird. Diese supponirte Grösse hat in der That mit der Null das gemein, dass beide sich nicht darstellen lassen. Aber die Rechtfertigung der Null durch die Theorie fehlt, wie bekannt, bei der fraglichen Grösse.",0
1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group. These objects possess a considerably richer structure; for instance, they are endowed with a non-trivial Lie algebra structure, and the differentials form no longer a complex but fulfil certain\nrelations which reflect in low degrees both the Maurer-Cartan equation and the Bianchi identity.\nIn the paper under review, the authors adapt the approach of \\textit{A. Kock} [Synthetic differential geometry (London Mathematical Lecture Note Series, 51, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc.) (1981; Zbl 0466.51008); Bull. Aust. Math. Soc. 25, 357--386 (1982; Zbl 0484.58005)] to these objects by using the following combinatorial definition. Let \\(X/S\\) be an \\(S\\)-scheme and let \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\subset X^{n+1}\\) be the subscheme of pairwise infinitesimally close \\((n+1)\\)-tuples of points. Then a \\(\\text{Lie}(G)\\) valued \\(n\\)-form, for an \\(S\\)-group scheme \\(G\\), is an \\(S\\)-morphism \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\rightarrow G\\). The authors give a substantial survey of these objects and related results, taking into account several technical subtleties in the general scheme-theoretic context.","What is synthetic differential geometry? It is something that most of us have met as students, when we first learn about calculus. Infinitesimal quantities, infinitesimal vectors, infinitesimal transformations and so forth, are not strange concepts, but explanations which use them are generally accompanied by an apology for lack of rigour. We know how to make rigorous analytic definitions which bypass the question `what is an infinitesimal quantity?', and yet when we want to explain something or draw pictures on the blackboard, we often fall back into the language of infinitesimals.\n\n\nThe preface of this book opens with the following translation of a passage from \\textit{Sophus Lie}'s ``Allgemeine Theorie der partiellen Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung'' [Math. Ann. 9, 245--296 (1875; JFM 07.0225.01)]: ``The reason why I have postponed for so long these investigations, which are basic to my other work in this field, is essentially the following. I found these theories originally by synthetic considerations. But I soon realized that, as expedient (zweckmÃ¤ÃŸig) the synthetic method is for discovery, as difficult it is to give a clear exposition on synthetic investigations, which deal, with objects that till now have almost been considered analytically. After long vacillations, I have decided to use a half synthetic, half analytic form. I hope my work will serve to bring justification to the synthetic method besides the analytical one.''\n\n\n It is important not to misunderstand what this book is about. ``The aim of the present book is to describe a foundation for synthetic reasoning in differential geometry.''\n\n\nIt is not attempting to put differential geometry on a different footing. It is not claiming to provide new synthetic arguments. The foundation which it describes fits into a much wider picture, which is hinted at, which has a naturalness that I am sure Lie would have applauded. On the other hand it may shock some readers; for this foundation is based on challenges to two assumptions that are dinned into us from our earliest mathematical training. We meet the first at the bottom of the first page of the first section of chapter I. I quote from this page:\n\n ``The geometric line can, as soon as one chooses two distinct points on it, be made into a commutative ring, with the two points as respectively 0 and 1. This is a decisive structure on it, already known and considered by Euclid, who assumes that his reader is able to move line segments around in the plane (which gives addition), and who teaches his reader how he, with ruler and compass, can construct the fourth proportional of three line segments; taking one of these to be \\([0,1]\\), this defines the product of the two others, and thus the multiplication on the line. We denote the line, with its commutative ring structure (relative to some fixed choice of 0 and 1) by the letter \\(R\\). Also, the geometric plane can, by some of the basic structure (ruler-and-compass-constructions again), be identified with \\(R\\times R=R^2\\) (choose a fixed pair of mutually orthogonal copies of the line \\(R\\) in it), and similarly, space with \\(R^3\\). Of course, this basic structure does not depend on having the (arithmetically constructed) real numbers \\(\\mathbb R\\) as a mathematical model for \\(R\\). Euclid maintained further that \\(R\\) was not just a commutative ring, but actually a field. This follows because of his assumption: for any two points in the plane, either they are equal, or they determine a unique line. We cannot agree with Euclid on this point.''\n\n\nThere may be many readers who automatically identify the linear continuum which we abstract from experience of the world around us, with \\(R\\). They should stop to realize that \\(\\mathbb R\\) is not so ``concrete'' a mathematical object as they suppose, and that, useful though it is for modelling some properties of the real world, there is no reason why we should expect it to be the only useful model. It is worth pointing out here that the models \\(R\\) employed in this book are not non-standard models of the reals, in the usual sense of non-standard arithmetic. The technique is to consider commutative rings \\(R\\) with nilpotent elements. Throughout the book, the object \\(D\\) given by \\(D:= \\{x\\in R\\mid x^2 =0\\}\\) plays a fundamental role. We may think of \\(D\\) as an infinitesimal neighbourhood of zero on the line. Axiom 1 states: For any \\(g\\in R^D\\) (the object of mappings from \\(D\\) to \\(R)\\) there exists a unique \\(b\\in R\\) such that \\(\\forall d\\in D: g(d) = g(0)+d.b\\). In other words, the graphs of mappings restricted to infinitesimal regions are straight lines. Three pages later we are confronted with the second challenge: ``Axiom 1 is incompatible with the law of excluded middle. Either the one or the other has to leave the scene. In Part I of this book, the law of excluded middle has to leave, being incompatible with the natural synthetic reasoning on smooth geometry to be presented here. In the terms which the logicians use, this means that the logic employed is `constructive' or `intuitionistic'.'' The lessons learnt about the relationship between mathematics and the real world from the work of Lobachevsky and Bolyai apply no less strongly to logic, but I fear they have not been equally appreciated. Most practicing mathematicians are probably not accustomed to monitoring their proofs for intuitionistic validity. The readers of this book need not take alarm; it in no way resembles a textbook on logic.\n\n\nThe main text of the book is divided into three sections, each divided into chapters. As the book is not a complete compendium of work done in this area, each chapter is followed by exercises which point to material not covered. After the three main sections there are short chapters on loose ends and historical remarks, three technical appendixes, references and an index.\n\n\nThe first part, the Synthetic Theory, explores the geometric significance of the axioms of the theory. In this part the role of logic is played down as far as possible, and a ``trick'' is employed to lull the reader who might be frightened by the logical aspects. The second, fairly brief part, Categorical Logic, analyzes in more detail the allowable rules for deducing theorems from the axioms. This section performs a valuable service to the mathematical public in giving a readable introduction to the ideas of categorical logic. The style of this section, in fact of the whole book, is to adopt the pregnant example rather than the most general case, to adopt the simplest and most suggestive notation, and to relate any new notion back to well known ones. For example, the chapter on geometric theories, instead of giving a general definition, looks at specific example of geometric theories in the language of commutative rings, with which the reader can be expected to be familiar. The third part, Models, looks at various models of the axioms. The chief aim, of course, is to find a model of the axioms which includes all smooth manifolds in a suitably nice way, so that the synthetic constructions and theorems should coincide with the usual analytic ones, and so that, furthermore, these constructions can be given a sensible meaning for smooth function spaces and other objects which are not strictly speaking manifolds.\n\n \nOf course, this book does not represent the first attempt at such a task, but I would claim it is the most coherent. The use of nilpotent elements to represent infinitesimals has a long history, running right up to modern algebraic geometry. Inevitably the approach described in this book shares many common features with algebraic geometry, and these are pointed out in the historical notes. There is an interesting reference to Protagoras who claimed that it was evident that the intersection of a circle with a tangent line consisted of more than a single point. The idea which led to much of these development was due to Lawvere; it was the idea of the representability of the tangent bundle (or more generally, of jet bundles): A tangent at a point \\(x\\) of an object \\(M\\) is defined to be a map \\(D{\\overset {t} \\rightarrow} M\\) such that \\(t(0)=x\\). The object \\(M^D\\) can then be identified with the object of tangents to \\(M\\), and the map \\(M{\\overset {\\pi} \\rightarrow} M\\) given by \\(t\\to t(0)\\) defines the tangent bundle. If \\(M\\) satisfies a condition called infinitesimal linearity, then it becomes possible to add tangents at the same point, and \\(M^D\\to M\\) becomes an \\(R\\)-module in the category of objects over \\(M\\). A vector field on \\(M\\) can now be described in three equivalent ways (by exponential adjointness, i.e. \\(\\lambda\\)-conversion): i) as a section \\(M{\\overset {\\xi} \\rightarrow} M^D\\), \\(\\pi\\xi = 1_M\\) of the tangent bundle, ii) as an infinitesimal flow \\(M\\times D{\\overset {\\xi} \\rightarrow}M\\), \\(\\xi(m,0)=m\\), iii) as a tangent to the identity map \\(D{\\overset {\\xi} \\rightarrow}M^M\\), \\(\\xi(0) = 1_M\\). The advantage of this over the analytic approach, is that for \\(d\\in D\\), \\(\\xi(d)\\) is an actual permutation of \\(M\\), and this can be exploited to give easy proofs of many theorems about vector fields. The first part of the book is like an hors d'hÅ“uvres tray; a lot of short chapters on a good many topics: elementary calculus, partial derivatives, tangent vectors, vector fields, the Lie bracket, order and integration, differential forms, currents, Stokes' theorem, Weil algebras, formal manifolds, differential forms as quantities rather than as functionals, incidence geometry.\n\n\nI have said that the first part uses a ``trick'' of notation to make it easier for the reader. I quote from the preface: ``Most of Part I, as well as several of the papers on the bibliography which go deeper into actual geometric matters with synthetic methods, are written in the ``naive'' style. By this, we mean that all notions, constructions, and proofs involved are presented as if the base category were the category of sets; in particular, all constructions on the objects involved are described in terms of ``elements'' of them. However, it is necessary and possible to be able to understand this naive writing as referring to Cartesian closed categories. It is necessary because the basic axioms of synthetic differential geometry have no models in the category of sets (cf. I \\S1); and it is possible: this is what Part II is about. The method is that we have to understand by an element \\(b\\) of an object \\(B\\) a generalized element, that is, a map \\(b: X\\to B\\), where \\(X\\) is an arbitrary object, called the stage of definition, or the domain of variation of the element \\(b\\). Elements ``defined as different stages'' have a long tradition in geometry. In fact, a special case of it is when the geometers say: A circle has no real points at infinity, but there are two imaginary points at infinity such that every circle passes through them. Here \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are two different stages of mathematical knowledge, and something that does not yet exist at stage \\(B\\) may come into existence at the ``later'' or ``deeper'' stage \\(C\\).\n\n\nI found one or two misprints, and `explicitly' is spelled `explicitely' right the way through, but these details do not obtrude. The general layout, the look of the pages, and the diagrams, are inviting and well done. It is in many ways an unusual book, with a strong individual flavour. It is both a textbook and a summary of recent research. It deals with some elementary aspects of mathematics in as simple a way as possible, and yet also involves some very subtle ideas. The first part can be read and enjoyed by a wide readership. The second part is more difficult, but is probably the most accessible primer on categorical logic yet published. The exercises and notes link the material in the book with so many other themes it is impossible in a review to do them justice.",1

The authors' approach is based on the energy shaping techniques of Takegaki and Arimoto. The regulators are described by control laws composed of the gradient of an artificial potential energy plus a linear velocity feedback. The authors provide an explicit set of sufficient conditions on the artificial potential energy. These conditions provide a direct means of obtaining strict Lyapunov functions that insure global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.


The authors also establish a framework for designing adaptive versions for this class of regulators. They propose an explicit update law that guarantees closed-loop stability and global positioning. In addition, they characterize the class of tracking controllers for which global uniform asymptotic stability is insured by strict Lyapunov functions.",0

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","As a succinct first summary essentially the authors own words may be the best ones: ``An elementary recursive bound on the degrees for Hilbert's 17th problem is given. More precisely, we express a nonnegative polynomial as a sum of squares of rational functions, and we obtain as degree estimates for the numerators and denominators the following tower of five exponentials \\(\\exp_2(\\exp_2(\\exp_2(\\exp_d(\\exp_4(k))))),\\) where \\(d\\) is the degree and \\(k\\) is the number of variables of the input polynomial and \\(\\exp_l(x)=l^x.\\) Our method is based on the proof of an elementary recursive bound on the degrees for Stengle's Positivstellensatz. More precisely, we give an algebraic certificate of the emptiness of the realization of a system of sign conditions and we obtain as degree bounds for this certificate a tower of five exponentials, namely \\( \\exp_2(\\exp_2(\\exp_2(\\max\\{2,d\\}^{4^k}+ s^{2^k}\\max\\{2,d\\}^{16^k \\text{bit}(d)})))\\) where \\(d\\) is a bound on the degrees, \\(s\\) is the number of polynomials and \\(k\\) is the number of variables of the input polynomials and bit(d) is the length of the binary representation of \\(d.\\)''\n\nThe reviewer continues giving some rough ideas of the concepts involved. Let \\(K\\) be an ordered field and let \\(K[x]=K[x_1,\\dots , x_k].\\) A system of signconditions in \\(K[x]\\) is a list \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\mathcal{F}_{\\neq},\\mathcal{F}_{\\geq}, \\mathcal{F}_{=} \\}\\) of three sets of polynomials (as indicated) in \\(K[x]\\) by which one defines, given an ordered field \\(L\\supseteq K,\\) the set \\(\\text{Real}(\\mathcal F, L)=\\{\\xi\\in L^k: \\text{ for all } P \\in \\mathcal F_{\\neq}, P(\\xi)\\neq 0, \\text{ for all } P \\in \\mathcal F_{\\geq}, P(\\xi)\\geq 0, \\text{ for all } P \\in \\mathcal F_{=}, P(\\xi)= 0 \\}.\\) Then \\(\\text{Real}(\\mathcal F, L)\\) is said to be the realization of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) in \\(L.\\) If \\(\\text{Real}(\\mathcal F, L)=\\emptyset\\) then the system \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is called unrealizable in \\(L.\\)\n\nNow consider a finite set \\(\\mathcal{P}\\subset K[x]\\) and \\( \\mathcal{P}^2=\\{p^2: p\\in \\mathcal P\\}.\\) Define \\(\\mathcal{M(P)}:=\\)multiplicative monoid generated by \\(\\mathcal{P};\\) \\(\\mathcal{N(P)}:=\\{\\text{ polynomials of form } \\sum_{i=1}^m \\omega_iV_i^2\\cdot N_i, \\text{ with } \\omega_i\\in K_{+}, V_i\\in K[x], N_i\\in \\mathcal{M(P)} \\}\\); and \\(\\mathcal{I(P)}:=\\)ideal generated by \\(\\mathcal{P} \\in K[x].\\) A system of sign conditions \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is is said incompatible, notation \\(\\downarrow \\mathcal{F}\\downarrow,\\) if there is an algebraic identity \\(S+N+Z=0\\) with \\(S\\in \\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal F_{\\neq}^2), N\\in \\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal F_{\\geq}), Z\\in \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal F_{=}).\\)\n\nA version of Stengle's Positivstellensatz [\\textit{G. Stengle}, Math. Ann. 207, 87--97 (1973; Zbl 0253.14001)] states that given a system of sign conditions \\(\\mathcal F,\\) its unrealizability in any ordered extension of \\(K\\) and its incompatibility are equivalent. Right on the first pages the authors show by very short proofs how the real Nullstellensatz can be deduced and from this in turn Stengle's improved version of Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. \\textit{H. Lombardi} [Lect. Notes Math. 1524, 323--345 (1992; Zbl 0782.14001)] has given complexity bounds for the Positivstellensatz which involve towers of powers of 2 whose length increase linearly with \\(k.\\) From this similar enormous bounds follow for the other two theorems. With the tools of weak inference and weak existence designed by Lombardi at the time and by replacing Cohen-Hoermander quantifier elimination by a new type of quantifier elimination based on Thom encoding of real algebraic numbers; see [\\textit{D. Perrucci} and \\textit{M.-F. Roy}, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 168, No. 8, 1588--1604 (2017; Zbl 1373.14060)], the authors achieve very notable improvements getting down from primitive recursive bounds to elementary recursive bounds. \\par Chapter 2 is dedicated to obtain many weak inference rules continuously used in later chapters. Assume \\(\\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{F}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{F}_m, \\mathcal{H}\\) are systems of sign conditions and we know that if \\(\\mathcal F\\) is satisfied at \\(\\vartheta\\in R^k\\), then one of \\(\\mathcal{F}_1, \\dots ,\\mathcal F_m\\) is satisfied at \\(\\vartheta\\). Then if the enlarged signconditions \\([\\mathcal F_1,\\mathcal H], \\dots, [\\mathcal F_m,\\mathcal H]\\) are unsatisfiable, then \\([\\mathcal F,\\mathcal H]\\) will be unsatisfiable. (Here, naturally \\([\\mathcal F,\\mathcal H]= \\{\\mathcal{F}_{\\neq}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{\\neq} , \\mathcal{F}_{\\geq}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{\\geq} , \\mathcal{F}_{=}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{=} \\}\\). ) A weak inference is a construction to reflect this on the incompatibility level: it produces from initial incompatibilities \\(\\downarrow \\mathcal F_1,\\mathcal H\\downarrow, \\downarrow \\mathcal F_2,\\mathcal H\\downarrow ,\\dots , \\downarrow \\mathcal F_m,\\mathcal H\\downarrow \\) a final incompatibility \\( \\downarrow \\mathcal F ,\\mathcal H\\downarrow. \\) Theorems proving such constructions are generically written \\( \\mathcal{F} \\vdash \\bigvee\\limits _{j=1}^m \\mathcal{F}_j,\\) making aptly use of well-known symbols of Logic. The authors accompany such theorems almost always with degree bounds. To give a flavour of such results we cite (using with the authors a notational abuse) \\par Lemma 2.17: Let \\(P\\in K[u]=K[u_1,\\dots,u_n].\\) Then \\(P\\neq 0 \\vdash P>0 \\vee P<0.\\) If we have incompatibilities in \\(K[v]\\) where \\(v \\supset u\\) with monoid part \\(S_1 \\cdot P^{2e_1}\\) and \\(S_2 \\cdot P^{2e_2}\\) and degree in \\(w\\subset v\\) bounded in \\(\\delta_{w,1}\\) and \\(\\delta_{w,2},\\) the final incompatibility has monoid part \\(S_1\\cdot S_2\\cdot P^{2(e_1+e_2)}\\) and degree in \\(w\\) bounded by \\(\\delta_{w,1}+ \\delta_{w,2}.\\) \\par Here and in similar theorems the superset of the original variable set creeps in via the auxiliary sign conditions \\(\\mathcal{H}.\\) Section 2 contains also a generalization of weak inference, called weak existence. An application of the principle of weak existence is the intermediate value theorem in chapter 3 which reads now as if \\(P= \\sum_{0\\leq h\\leq p} C_h y^h \\in K[u][y],\\) then \\( \\exists(t_1,t_2) [C_p \\neq 0, P(t_1)P(t_2)\\leq 0] \\vdash \\exists [P(t)=0].\\) Here already the degree estimates for the final incompatibility are doubly exponential in \\(p\\) (the degree of \\(P\\) with respect to \\(y\\)). The proof is based on the fact that if a field is real its extension by an irreducible polynomial of odd degree is also real, an idea \\textit{E. Artin} [Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hamb. 5, 100--115 (1926; JFM 52.0122.01)] used in his famous solution to Hilbert' s 17th problem. The theorem is used to prove the weak existence of the real root for a monic polynomial of odd degree (again with doubly exponential bounds). Chapter 4 uses this theorem to give a weak existence form of the fundamental theorem of algebra for a polynomial \\(p\\) based on Laplace's proof by induction on the largest nonnegative integer \\(r\\) such that \\(2^r|\\deg p.\\) The chapter continues with sections on the decomposition of polynomials into irreducible factors also with multiplicities. Hermite created a theory in which a quadratic form (hence a matrix Her\\((P,Q)\\) -- in fact a Hankel matrix) is associated to two one-variable real polynomials \\(P,Q\\) and which allows to express the number of roots in \\(\\mathbb C\\) of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is nonzero as the rank of the matrix Her\\((P,Q);\\) and the difference of the number of real roots of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is positive minus the number of roots of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is negative as the signature of Her\\((P,Q).\\) This theorem and its formulation in terms of weak inference and attendant degree estimates are the object of the long chapter 5. Along the way Sylvester's law of inertia is treated and a link of Hermite's theory to subresultants is given. Chapter 6 is titled `Elimination of one variable' . In Section 6.1 it is noted that given a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(p\\) in \\(K[y],\\) the signs of the first \\(p-1\\) derivatives of \\(P\\) at a real root \\(\\theta\\) of \\(P\\) define a sequence which is unique to it. This is called Thom encoding of \\(\\theta\\) with respect to \\(P.\\) It gives rise to a new elimination method for families \\(\\mathcal Q\\) of univariate polynomials which depend on parameters. \\(\\text{Elim}(\\mathcal Q)\\) is a family of polynomials which determines the realizable sign conditions of \\(\\mathcal Q.\\) A classic method for this is Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition -- see e.g. [\\textit{B. F. Caviness} (ed.) and \\textit{J. R. Johnson} (ed.), Quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic decomposition. Proceedings of a symposium, Linz, Austria, October 6--8, 1993. Wien: Springer (1998; Zbl 0906.03033)] -- but this is because its close connection to topology (semi-algebraic connectivity) not suitable for getting algebraic identities for showing incompatibilities. The chapter relies heavily on chapter 2 of course but uses only the two culminating results from chapters 4 and 5 respectively. Finally chapter 7 proves the two main results with which the paper opened: it establishes elementary recursive bounds as well for the Positivstellensatz as for the solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. Only the main result of chapter 6 is used. The annex, chapter 8, gives a number estimates for the multiple exponentials used earlier. \\par Although the paper is quite technical and the statements of the theorems because of the constructive nature and/or the complexity estimates longer than usual, the exposition which uses in later chapters only the culminating results of earlier ones will help to grasp more rapidly the main thread of reasoning. The paper resumes certainly decades of work and presents a breakthrough in its area.",1

Name: text, dtype: object","In this short paper the author announces a Plancherel formula for reductive symmetric spaces \(X=G_ C/G_ R\) where \(G_ C\) is a complex linear connected reductive group and \(G_ R\) is its real form. The latter means that \(G_ R\) is an open subgroup of the fixed point subgroup of some involutive automorphism \(\tau\) of \(G_ C\) (as a real group). The symmetric space X is dual in some sense to the group \(G_ R\) viewed as the symmetric space \(G_ R\times G_ R/diagonal.\)


Denote \({\mathfrak g}_ C=Lie G_ C\), \({\mathfrak g}_ R=Lie G_ R\). Then \({\mathfrak g}_ C={\mathfrak g}_ R+{\mathfrak q}\) where \({\mathfrak q}=i{\mathfrak g}_ R\). For any Cartan subspace \({\mathfrak j}\) of \({\mathfrak q}\) there is defined some family of \(G_ R\)-invariant distributions on X called spherical distributions. They have a simple explicit expression. Let \({\mathfrak j}_ 1,...,{\mathfrak j}_ m\) be a maximal set of Cartan subspaces such that no two of them are conjugate under \(K\cap G_ R\) (K being a maximal compact subgroup of \(G_ C\) invariant under \(\tau\)). Let f be a function in \(C_ c^{\infty}(X)\) and \(f_ 0\) a function in \(C_ c^{\infty}(G_ C)\) which gives f through integrating over cosets. Let \(f^*_ 0(g)=\overline{f_ 0(g^{-1})}\). The Plancherel formula decomposes the scalar square of f in \(L^ 2(X)\) into the values of spherical distributions corresponding to \({\mathfrak j}_ 1,...,{\mathfrak j}_ m\) at \(f_ 0*f^*_ 0\). The Plancherel measure is shown explicitly. In the paper some symbols remain unexplained.",0
1969249,"Instanton bundles on \\(\\mathbb{P}^3\\) have received special interest in the last decades, since they are related by twistor theory to self-dual Yang-Mills fields on \\(S^4\\). Such bundles \\({\\mathcal E}\\) can be characterized as rank \\(2\\) bundles with first Chern class \\(0\\), fulfilling \\(H^0({\\mathcal E})=H^1({\\mathcal E}(-1))=0\\). Equivalently, they can be given as the cohomology of a monad \\({\\mathcal O}(-1)^n\\rightarrow {\\mathcal O}^{2n+2}\\rightarrow {\\mathcal O}(1)^n\\) with \\(n=c_2({\\mathcal E})\\).\n\nIn the paper under review, the author investigates the geometry of \\(\\mathbf{I}_3\\), the moduli space of such bundles for \\(n=3\\). \\textit{G. Ellingsrud} and \\textit{S.A. StrÃ¸mme} [Math. Ann. 255, 123--135 (1981; Zbl 0438.14009)] proved the \nirreducibility and smoothness of \\(\\mathbf{I}_3\\). \\textit{L. Gruson} and \\textit{M. Skiti} [Math. Ann. 298, No. 2, 253--273 (1994; Zbl 0810.14008)] gave a geometric description in terms of nets of quadrics. Moreover, they deduced from the constructed birational isomorphism the geometry of two boundary components.\nHere, the special interest is in two new boundary components, following the lines of the author's previous paper [C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, SÃ©r. I, Math. 330, No. 3, 217--220 (2000; Zbl 1058.14017)]. In some sense, both components are dual, since they are given by degenerate cubo-cubic transformations of the monad which turn out to be mutually inverse. Furthermore, a fibration structure is given. \n\nVia the curve of cohomology jumping planes, both components are related to moduli of special curves in \\(\\mathbb{P}^{3\\vee}\\), which allows the author to construct a birational description of the moduli space of genus 2 and degree 7 curves (resp. genus 6 and degree 9 curves).","Instead of computing the singular values of a general matrix \(A \in \mathbb C^{m \times n}\) and thus revealing the eigenvalues of \(AA^*\) and \(A^*A\), one may ask for a canonical form for \(A\) that reveals the eigenvalues of the complex symmetric matrices \(AA^T\) and \(A^TA\).

The authors obtain such a form by solving a more general problem considering a triple of matrices \((A,G, \hat G)\) with \(A \in \mathbb C^{m \times n}, G \in \mathbb C^{m \times m}\) and \(\hat G \in \mathbb C^{n \times n}\), where \(G\) and \(\hat G\) are nonsingular and either complex symmetric or complex skew-symmetric. Then they derive canonical forms for matrix triples \((A, G, \hat G)\) that provide the Jordan canonical forms of the structured matrices \(\hat {\mathcal H} = \hat G^{-1}A^TG^{-1}A\) and \({\mathcal H} = G^{-1}A\hat G^{-1}A^T\).",0

Our motivation is from cryptography via the use of genus 2 curves with a prescribed number of points, and from class invariants with a view towards class field theory and Stark's conjectures. All known methods for constructing such curves rely on complex multiplication and the calculation of Igusa class polynomials. These polynomials have rational coefficients and their determination requires extensive computation and precision. The results of this paper make it possible now to perform complexity analysis of these algorithms. The analysis for bounding the denominators also informs the prime factorization for certain class invariants. Both problems are translated into questions about isomorphisms between principally polarized abelian surfaces with complex multiplication and products of elliptic curves with the product polarization, over local artinian rings. We give an overview of Igusa's results on the moduli space of genus 2 curves and the method to construct genus 2 curves via their Igusa invariants. We also give a complete characterization of the reduction type of a CM abelian surface, for any type of prime decomposition of the prime, including ramified primes. The methods used in the proofs of the main results involve studying the embedding problem of the quartic CM field into certain matrix algebras over quaternions and invoking techniques from crystalline deformation theory.",1

Name: text, dtype: object","The object of study is the moduli space \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)\\) of maps from a fixed (smooth projective geometrically irreducible) curve \\(C\\) to a variety \\(X\\) such that the cycle of its image is some fixed element \\(y\\) of \\(\\mathrm{NS}(X)^\\vee\\). There is known an explicit lower bound on the dimension of the irreducible components of \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)\\), depending on the dimension of \\(X\\), the genus of \\(C\\) and the intersection pairing of \\(y\\) with \\(K_X\\). This bound is called the \\textit{expected dimension} of \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)\\). In this context one can ask for the actual dimension of this space and the number of its irreducible components.\n\nIn this article, the author answers these questions in a specific situation. There, \\(X\\) should be a smooth projective geometrically irreducible variety defined over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), whose Cox ring is given as a quotient of a polynomial ring \\(k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]\\) by one equation \\(f\\). Moreover, \\(f\\) should be linear with respect to a subset of the variables \\(x_i\\) in such a way that the coefficients of these variables are pairwise coprime monomials in the remaining variables.\n\nThere are more explicit combinatorial restrictions on \\(f\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathrm{Eff}(X)^\\vee\\), which have to be fulfilled. But then the main theorem states, that if \\(C\\) is defined over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), then there is an open dense irreducible subset \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)^\\circ\\) of \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)\\) that has the expected dimension. This open subset consists of all maps which do not factor through the divisors of sections corresponding to the variables \\(x_i\\) in the Cox ring.\n\nSince \\(C\\) and \\(X\\) are defined over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), the theorem can be established by counting the number of points in reductions of open subsets of \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(C,X,y)\\) modulo a prime \\(p\\). The actual dimension can then be deduced from the asymptocial behaviour of the number of \\(\\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\\)-points for \\(r \\to \\infty\\).\n\nFinally, the author gives two classes of examples. On the one hand, the assumptions are fulfilled for so-called \\textit{intrinsic quadrics}, see also [\\textit{D. Bourqui}, Manuscr. Math. 135, No. 1--2, 1--41 (2011; Zbl 1244.14018)]. On the other hand, minimal resolutions of singular del Pezzo surfaces are considered. By the classification found in [\\textit{U. Derenthal}, ``Singular del Pezzo surfaces whose universal torsors are hypersurfaces'', \\url{arXiv:math.AG/0604194}], there are \\(20\\) such surfaces which fulfill the assumptions for at least one non-zero \\(y\\). Actually, \\(y\\) can be chosen arbitrarily for ten of those surfaces. For the remaining ten, only a subcone of \\(\\mathrm{Eff}(X)^\\vee\\) satisfies the assumptions of the theorem. The author gives the ratios of the volumes of this subcone and \\(\\mathrm{Eff}(X)^\\vee\\).",1
1587247,"\\textit{P. B. Kronheimer} [J. Differ. Geom. 29, 665-683 (1989; Zbl 0671.53045)] has constructed quiver varieties from extended Dynkin diagrams of types \\(\\widetilde A_n,\\widetilde D_n,\\widetilde E_n\\). These quiver varieties are important objects for the study of simple singularities. Let \\(p\\) be the quotient map of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group. The semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities are constructed on the quotient space of Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group of corresponding types. Then these quiver varieties are the pull-back of semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities by the quotient map \\(p\\). These quiver varieties are obtained as the symplectic quotients of symplectic vector spaces by a reductive group. So the coordinate rings are invariant subrings of polynomial rings with respect to the action of the group. In general it is difficult to find a minimal set of generators of an invariant ring and the relations between them.\n\n\nIn this paper the author shows that this is possible for the case of quiver varieties constructed by P. B. Kronheimer. Moreover surprisingly it can be shown that the obtained relation is unique and irreducible. In this research the invariant theory of quivers by \\textit{L. Le Bruyn} and \\textit{C. Procesi} [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 317, 585-598 (1990; Zbl 0693.16018)] and of matrices of low degrees by \\textit{K. Nakamoto} [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 166, 125-148 (2002; Zbl 1001.15022)] is used.","The author presents a rather detailed survey of results concerning the concept of \(p\)-hyperbolicity and \(p\)-parabolicity of Riemannian manifolds and graphs (see related topics in [\textit{I. Holopainen}, Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn., Ser. A I. Math., Diss. 74 (1990; Zbl 0698.31010), \textit{T. Coulhon} and \textit{L. Saloff-Coste}, Rev. Mat.

J. 7, 135-146 (1977; Zbl 0382.90088), \textit{V. A. Zorich} and \textit{V. M. Kesel'man}, Funct. Anal. Appl. 30, No. 2, 106-117 (1996; Zbl 0873.53025)]), and proves some new geometric criteria for the \(p\)-hyperbolicity and \(p\)-parabolicity. The material of the paper is supplied with various examples of \(p\)-hyperbolic and \(p\)-parabolic manifolds.


Definition. Let \((M,g)\) be a Riemannian manifold and let \(\Omega \subset M\) be a compact set. For \(1\leq p<\infty\) the \(p\)-capacity of \(D\) in \(\Omega\) is defined as follows:
\[
 \text{Cap}_p(D,\Omega)=\inf\Bigl\{\int\limits{\Omega} |du|^p: u\in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)\cap C_0^0(\Omega), \;u|_{D}\geq 1 \Bigr\},
\]
 where the Sobolev space \(W_0^{1,p}\) is the closure of \(C_0^1(\Omega)\), the space of compactly supported \(C^1\)-functions, with respect to the Sobolev norm \(\|u\|_{1,p}=\|u\|_{L_p}+\|du\|_{L_p}\).


A Riemannian manifold is \(p\)-hyperbolic (\(1\leq p<\infty\)) if it includes a compact set of positive \(p\)-capacity, and \(p\)-parabolic otherwise. Using some properties of the \(p\)-harmonic functions and \(p\)-capacity [see \textit{J. Heinonen}, \textit{T.~Kilpeläinen}, and \textit{O. Martio}, Nonlinear potential theory of degenerate elliptic equations, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1993; Zbl 0780.31001)], the author establishes the following propositions:


Theorem 4.4. Let \(E\) be a subset of a Riemannian manifold \(M\). Then


(a)~if \(E\subset M\) has local positive \(p\)-capacity, then \(\Omega=M\setminus E\) is \(p\)-hyperbolic;


(b)~if \(M\) is \(p\)-parabolic and \(E\subset M\) is a \(p\)-polar set, then \(\Omega=M\setminus E\) is \(p\)-parabolic.


Corollary 4.1. Let \(M\) be a closed Riemannian manifold and let \(E\subset M\) be of Hausdorff dimension \(s\) (\(0<s<n=\text{dim} (M)\)). Then \(\Omega=M\setminus E\) is \(p\)-parabolic whenever \(1<p<n-s\) and \(p\)-hyperbolic whenever \(p>n-s\).


For a Riemannian manifold \(M\) with warped cylindrical end (i.e. such that there are a compact Riemannian manifold \((N, g_N)\) and a compact set \(D\subset M\) such that \(M\setminus D\) is a direct product of \(N\) and \([1,\infty)\) with Riemannian metric \(dt^2+f^2(t)g_N\)) the author proves the following criterion:


Corollary 5.2. The manifold \(M\) (with warped cylindrical end) is \(p\)-parabolic if and only if \(\int^{\infty}_1 f(t)^{\frac{n-1}{1-p}} dt=\infty\).


Definition. A function \(P\:[0,V)\to \mathbb R\) is an isoperimetric profile for an open set \(\Omega\subset (M,g)\) (\(V=\text{Vol} \Omega\)) if there are constants \(C\), \(\nu\) such that \(\nu<V\) and \(P(\text{Vol} D)\leq C\text{Area} \partial D\) for all compact regions \(D\subset\Omega\) with \(\nu\leq \text{Vol} D\).


Theorem 5.3. Suppose that a domain \(\Omega\subset (M,g)\) admits an isoperimetric profile \(P\:[0,V)\to \mathbb R\) such that \(\int_{\nu}^V\frac{dv}{[P(v)]^{p/(p-1)}} <\infty\), \(1<p<\infty\). Then \(\Omega\) is \(p\)-hyperbolic.


The author also establishes some criteria of the \(p\)-parabolicity via the area and the volume growth of the balls \(B(x_0,r)\) (\(r\to \infty\)) of a complete Riemannian manifold \(M\). He introduces the notion of the parabolic dimension \(d_{\text{par}}\) of a manifold (see the definition below) and proves criteria for \(p\)-parabolicity for manifolds \(M\) with bounded geometry using this notion: a manifold \(M\) is \(p\)-parabolic whenever \(p>d_{\text{par}}\), and \(p\)-hyperbolic whenever \(p<d_{\text{par}}\).


Definition. The parabolic dimension of \(M\) is the number \(d_{\text{par}}(M)=\inf\{p\geq 1: M\) is \(p\)-parabolic\}.",0
1445475,"This article is the second part of a series of two papers, the first one being [\\textit{M. Finkelberg} and \\textit{I. Mirkovic}, in: Differential topology, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, and applications. D. B. Fuchs' 60th anniversary collection. AMS Transl., Ser. 2, Am. Math.

There, systems of spaces \\(\\mathcal Z^\\alpha \\subset \\mathcal Q^\\alpha\\) of ``quasi-maps'' from \\(\\mathbb{P}^1\\) to the flag variety of simple group \\(G\\) were used to construct the space \\(\\mathcal{PS}\\) of perverse sheaves on the quotient of \\(G((z))\\) modulo the connected component of \\(B((z))\\), equivariant with respect to the Iwahori subgroup \\(I\\subset G[[z]]\\).

Local and Global Intersection Cohomology of Quasimaps' Spaces'', \\url{arXiv:alg-geom/9711009}] for the space of quasimaps. Here the author similarly takes the approach of Kontsevich's stable maps from nodal deformations of the curve into twisted flag varieties to obtain the desired resolution of singularities. As an application, the author shows that the twisted intersection cohomology sheaf on Drinfeld's compactification is universally locally acyclic at points sufficiently antidominant relative to their defect.",1

A collection \({\mathcal B}\) of \(k\)-dimensional subspaces of \(V\) such that any \(t\)-dimensional subspace of \(V\) is contained in exactly \(\lambda\) subspaces from \({\mathcal B}\) is called a \(t- (n,k, \lambda)\)-design over \(GF (q)\). The subspaces in \({\mathcal B}\) are called the blocks of the design. It is not hard to see that if \(t=2\), one gets an ordinary 2-design (BIBD) by taking as your varieties the 2-dimensional subspaces of \(V\) (that is, the points of the projective space \(PG(n - 1,q))\) and identifying each block with the set of 1-dimensional subspaces contained in it. The first nontrivial examples of designs over finite fields, as defined above, were given by the author in Geom. Dedicta 24, 237-242 (1987; Zbl 0627.51013), and since then numerous other examples have been created. However, no such designs have been constructed for \(t=2\) and \(\lambda =1\) (hence \(k \geq 3)\). In this setting nontrivial means that \({\mathcal B}\) does not consist of all the \(k\)-dimensional subspaces of \(V\).


If \({\mathcal B}\) is a nontrivial \(2-(n, k,1)\)-design over \(GF(q)\) and we associate with it the corresponding BIBD on the points of \(\Sigma = PG (n-1, q)\) as above, then each point \(P\) of \(\Sigma\) induces a \((k-1)\)-spread \(S_p = \{W/P : W \in {\mathcal B}, P \in W\}\) on \(\Sigma/P\). If this spread is a geometric spread for all points \(P\) of \(\Sigma\), then \({\mathcal B}\) is called a geometric design. Recall that a projective spread \(S\) is geometric if whenever three distinct elements \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(A_3\) are chosen from \(S\), then either \(A_3 \cap \langle A_1, A_2 \rangle = \emptyset\) or \(A_3 \subseteq \langle A_1, A_2 \rangle\). The thrust of this paper is to show that there are no geometric designs over a finite field. The proof involves studying a purported class of partial geometries whose blocks form a collection of maximal totally isotropic subspaces of a symplectic space.",0
1700879,"Toric varieties often provide an excellent class of examples in the study of complicated questions in algebraic geometry. On the one hand, due to their correspondence to fans, many questions can be reduced to completely combinatorial properties, on the other hand, they represent an ample cross-section of all varieties. These nice properties can be also effectively exploited for the computation of Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a nonsingular complex toric variety.

In the first part, these class is described in combinatorial terms, and it it shown that such a variety is always an iterated blow-up of a product of projective spaces. The second part gives the proof of the quantum Giambelli formula in this situation. It is based on Batyrev's representation of \\(QH^*(X)\\) and and doesn't need the construction of a virtual fundamental class.","Summary: This paper is concerned with the scheduling of Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) under the condition of their utilization on one sector or within several interacting sectors. Based on the introduction of the train connection graph which describes the possible connection relationship between trains, the integer programming model of EMU circulation planning is constructed. In order to analyzing the resolution of the model, a heuristic which shares the characteristics with the existing methods is introduced first. This method consists of two stages: one is a greedy strategy to construct a feasible circulation plan fragment, and another is to apply a stochastic disturbance to it to generate a whole feasible solution or get a new feasible solution. Then, an exact branch and bound method which is based on graph designing is proposed. Due to the complexity, the lower bound is computed through a polynomial approximation algorithm which is a modification from the one solving the degree constraint minimum 1-tree problem. Then, a branching strategy is designed to cope with the maintenance constraints. Finally, we report extensive computational results on a railway corridor in which the sectors possess the basic feature of railway networks.",0

Let us recall the Artin Approximation Theorem: Let \\(f(x,y)\\in\\mathbb C\\{x,y\\}^p\\) be a vector of convergent power series in two sets of variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let \\(y(x)\\in\\mathbb C[[x]]^m\\) be a given formal power series solution vanishing at~\\(0\\) \n\\[\nf(x,y(x))=0.\n\\]\n\n\nThen for any \\(c\\in\\mathbb N\\) there exists a convergent power series solution \\(\\tilde y(x)\\in\\mathbb C\\{x\\}^m\\) vanishing at~\\(0\\) \n\\[\nf(x,\\tilde y(x))=0\n\\]\n such that the terms of \\(\\tilde y(x)\\) agree with the terms of \\(y(x)\\) up to degree \\(c\\): \n\\[\n\\tilde y(x)-y(x)\\in (x)^c.\n\\]\n The paper is organized as follows: in a first part the Artin Approximation Theorem and several variations of it are presented. In a second part the author ``presents a systematic argument which proves, with minor modifications, all theorems simultaneously'' (according to the author). After a presentation of the Weierstrass Division Theorem and some variations of it, the author reviews some results on algebraic power series. The end of the paper is devoted to review some results of the author concerning the Artin Approximation Theorem and the properties of algebraic power series.\n\nUnfortunately, there are numerous mistakes and erroneous claims that may mislead the reader. The main problems concern the proofs of the several variations of the Artin Approximation Theorem (even if these results are correct since they have been proven by several authors before). These variations essentially assert the existence of a convergent solution \\(\\tilde y(x)\\in\\mathbb C\\{x\\}^m\\) of \\(f=0\\) under some weaker hypothesis than in the Artin Approximation Theorem (namely one only requires that \\(f=0\\) has approximate solutions up to some well chosen orders). We explain here the most problematic mistakes:\n\n\\(\\bullet\\) The first proof is the proof of the classical Artin Approximation Theorem and is essentially the original proof of M.~Artin. But before giving the proof the authors presents the strategy of proof (at the end of page 603): ``We will construct from \\(f\\) [\\dots] a new vector of power series \\(f'=f'(x',w)\\) in the first \\(n-1\\) components \\(x'=(x_1,\\ldots, x_{n-1})\\) of the \\(x\\)-variables and in new variables \\(w=(w_0,\\ldots, w_{d-1})\\) such that the existence of a formal or convergent solution \\(y(x)\\) to \\(f(x,y)=0\\) is \\textit{equivalent} to the existence of a formal or convergent solution \\(w(x')\\) of \\(f'(x',w)=0\\).''\n\nThen ``We will show that the formal solutions \\(\\widehat y(x)\\) of the first system are in one-to-one correspondence with the formal solutions \\(\\widehat w(x')\\) of the latter system, and that the same correspondence holds for the convergent solutions [\\dots]''.\n\nThis claim is absolutely wrong as it can be checked already in Step 1 of the proof:\n\n(a) Indeed on line 5 of Step 1 (p. 604) the author already replaces the ideal generated by \\(f\\) by the ideal of all convergent equations satisfied by \\(\\widehat y(x)\\). This replacement depends on \\(\\widehat y(x)\\) and will produce a set of equations whose solutions are not in correspondence with the solutions of \\(f=0\\). We provide an explicit counter-example: For instance let \n\\[\ny(x)=(x_1,0,\\ldots, 0)\n\\]\n and \\(f(x,y)=y_2\\). We have that \\(f(x,y(x))=0\\). The ideal of all convergent equations satified by \\(y(x)\\) is the ideal generated by \n\\[\nf':=(y_1-x_1, y_2,\\ldots, y_m)\n\\]\n which is really much bigger than the ideal generated by \\(f\\). Moreover \\(y(x) =(2x_1,0,\\ldots,0)\\) is a solution of \\(f=0\\) but not of \\(f'=0\\).\n\n(b) A bit further one more reduction destroys also this correspondence. From \\(f\\) (generating the ideal \\(I\\)) the author constructs a new system of equations \\(f^*\\) (generating an ideal \\(I^*\\)) for which there exist \\(g\\notin I\\) and \\(b\\in\\mathbb N\\) and such that: \n\\[\nI^*\\subset I\\text{ and }g^b\\cdot I\\subset I^*.\n\\]\n The first inclusion shows that the solutions of \\(f=0\\) are solutions of \\(f^*=0\\). But the second inclusion only shows that the solutions of \\(f^*=0\\) \\textit{which are not solutions of \\(g=0\\)} are also solutions of \\(f=0\\). So the solutions of \\(f=0\\) and \\(f^*=0\\) are not in one-to-one correspondence but \\(f\\) is replaced by \\(f^*\\) in the proof.\n\n\\(\\bullet\\) Then the author's attempt of providing a systematic argument to prove ``simultaneously'' the next results leads him to make fatal mistakes or improper shortcuts that make the proofs of the Parametrized Approximation Theorem, the Strong Approximation Theorem I, the Strong Approximation Theorem II and the Uniform Strong Approximation Theorem incorrect. Let us explain some of them (at least the most important ones from our point of view):\n\n(a) Parametrized Approximation Theorem. Let \\(\\mathbb K\\) be a valued field of characteristic zero and let \\(f(x,y)\\) be a vector of convergent power series in two sets of variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Assume given a formal power series solution \\(y(x)\\) vanishing at 0, \n\\[\nf(x,y(x)) = 0.\n\\]\n Then there exists a convergent power series solution \\(y(x, z)\\) depending on \\(x_1,\\dots,x_n\\) and new variables \\(z = (z_1, \\ldots, z_s)\\), \n\\[\nf(x,y(x,z)) = 0,\n\\]\n and a vector of formal power series \\(\\widehat z(x) = (\\widehat z (x), \\ldots, \\widehat z(x))\\) vanishing at 0 such that \n\\[\n\\widehat y(x) = y(x, \\widehat z(x)).\n\\]\n The only proof is given by these two sentences (point (a) of Section 4 on page 607):``The proof of the parametrization theorem in both settings, the convergent and the algebraic one, does not need any substantial changes, provided that one refers in the induction step also to the stronger assertion as indicated in the theorem. The partial parametrization of the solution set of \\(f (x, y) = 0\\) nearby a formal solution \\(\\widehat y(x)\\) is then constructed by working again backwards from the partial parametrization of the system \\(f'(x', w) = 0\\)''. But this is not enough. Indeed it does not explain why and how, at each step of the induction, one has to introduce new variables \\(z\\) which do not appear in the statement or in the proof of the ``Analytic Approximation Theorem''. For instance for the case \\(n=0\\) the solutions of \\(f=0\\) are power series in \\(n=0\\) variables, i.e. they are elements of the base field \\(\\mathbb K\\). Thus formal and convergent solutions are the same and no variable \\(z\\) is required. So when one deduces the case \\(n=1\\) from the case \\(n=0\\) one has to explain why the variables \\(z\\) appear. This is in fact the whole difficulty of the proof of this theorem.\n\n(b) In the proof of the \\textit{Strong Approximation Theorem I} (point (b), page 607), the author introduces ``the ideal \\(I\\) of convergent power series \\(h(x, y)\\) for which the order of \\(h(x, y^{(k)}(x))\\) tends towards infinity for all sequences \\(y^{(k)}(x)\\) of power series vectors for which the order of \\(f(x,y^{(k)}(x))\\) tends towards infinity''. Then he claims that this ideal is prime, a fact that is essential for the rest of the proof. But this claim is wrong as the following example shows (even if the ideal \\((f)\\) of the equations is prime):\n\nLet \\(f=y_1^2y_2^2+xy_3^2y_4^2\\) where \\(x\\) is one variable. If \\(y^{(k)}(x)\\) is sequence such that the order of \\(f(x,y^{(k)}(x))\\) tends towards infinity then the order of \\((y_1^{(k)}y_2^{(k)})^2\\) and the order of \\(x(y_3^{(k)}y_4^{(k)})^2\\) tend towards infinity since their initial terms cannot cancel (the order of the first one is even while the order of the second one is odd). So the orders of \\(y_1^{(k)}y_2^{(k)}\\) and \\(y_3^{(k)}y_4^{(k)}\\) tend also towards infinity. Thus \\(y_1y_2\\in I\\) and \\(y_3y_4\\in I\\).\n\nBut if we consider the sequence \\(y^{(k)}(x)\\) given by \n\\[\ny^{(2l)}(x)=(x^{2l},1,x^{2l},1) \\;\\;\\forall l\\geq 0\n\\]\n \n\\[\ny^{(2l+1)}(x)=(1,x^{2l+1},1, x^{2l+1})\\;\\;\\forall l\\geq 0\n\\]\n we have that the order of \\(f(x,y^{(k)}(x))\\) tends towards infinity but none of the orders of the \\(y_i^{(k)}(x)\\) tends towards infinity. So neither \\(y_1\\) nor \\(y_2\\in I\\) and \\(I\\) is not a prime ideal.\n\n(c) A second problem concerns the proof of the Strong Approximation Theorem II. For the convenience of the reader we state this result:\n\n\\textit{Strong Approximation Theorem II:} Let \\(f (x, y)\\) be a vector of formal power series in two sets of variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For any \\(c\\in\\mathbb N\\) there exists an integer \\(e\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) such that if \\(f(x,y) = 0\\) admits an approximate solution \\(y(x)\\) up to degree \\(e\\) and vanishing at 0, \n\\[\nf(x,y(x)) \\in (x)^e,\n\\]\n then there exists an exact formal solution \\(\\widetilde y(x)\\) to \\(f (x, y) = 0\\), as \n\\[\nf(x,\\widetilde y(x)) = 0,\n\\]\n and such that \\(\\widetilde y(x) \\equiv y(x)\\) modulo \\((x)^c\\).\n\nIn the proof of this theorem the author writes (line -14 on page 608) ``So fix some \\(e\\), and consider an approximate solution \\(y(x)\\) of \\(f(x,y) = 0\\) up to degree \\(e\\).'' Then he writes ``If \\(g(x,y(x)) \\equiv 0\\) modulo \\((x)^e\\), increase \\(e\\) by 1 and repeat.'' which does not seem possible since \\(y(x)\\) may not be an approximate solution of \\(f(x,y)=0\\) up to degree this new \\(e\\) (i.e. \\(e+1\\)) Nevertheless, a few lines further, he writes if \\(g(x,y(x))\\neq 0\\) modulo \\((x)^e\\) for some \\(e\\), we may apply a generic linear triangular coordinate change to turn \\(g(x, y(x))\\) into an \\(x_n\\)-regular series of order \\(e\\).''\n\nThus the main problem here is that for this new integer \\(e\\), \\(y(x)\\) has no reason to be an approximate solution of \\(f(x,y)=0\\) up to degree \\(e\\) and this reduction cannot apply. For instance if we have \n\\[\nf(x,y(x))\\in (x)^{1000}\\backslash (x)^{1001}\n\\]\n \n\\[\n\\text{ and }g(x,y(x))\\in (x)^{2000}\\backslash (x)^{2001}\n\\]\n the argument consists in choosing \\(e\\) being simultaneously equal to an integer less than 1000 and to an integer greater than 2001.\n\nLet us mention that the same problem appears also in the proof of the \\textit{Uniform Strong Approximation Theorem}.\n\n\\(\\bullet\\) Finally let us mention another problem that may have consequences for the uninformed reader. On page 615 one reads: ``The set of algebraic series forms a subring \\(\\mathbb K\\langle x\\rangle\\) of \\(\\mathbb K[[x]]\\) which is closed under derivation but not under composition with other algebraic series.'' But it is well known that this ring is closed under composition with other algebraic series: if \\(x\\) is a set of variables and \\(y\\) is a single variable, and \\(g(x,y)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) are two algebraic power series, we denote by \\(P(x,y,t)\\) and \\(Q(x,y)\\) irreducible polynomials such that \n\\[\nP(x,y,g(x,y))=0 \\text{ and } Q(x,f(x))=0.\n\\]\n Then we have that \n\\[\nR(x,t):=\\text{Res}_y(P(x,y,t),Q(x,y))\n\\]\n is nonzero and \n\\[\nR(x,g(x,f(x)))=0.\n\\]\n So \\(g(x,f(x))\\) is algebraic. Then, in the general case, one deduces the algebraicity of \\(g(x,f_1(x),\\ldots, f_m(x))\\), where \\(g\\) and the \\(f_i\\) are algebraic power series, by induction on \\(m\\).\n\n Editorial remark: Meanwhile, an erratum has appeared [\\url{doi:10.1090/bull/1606}] to clarify and complement various places in the article.",1
1700879,"Toric varieties often provide an excellent class of examples in the study of complicated questions in algebraic geometry.

The note presents a modification to filtering so that \(u_F(x)\) satisfies the same boundary conditions as \(u_N(x)\). The key idea is to rewrite \(u_N(x)\) in terms of new basis functions which individually satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions and then apply the filter to modify the coefficients of the new expansion. The filtered sum is then converted back into the original basis.",0

The basic idea is to reduce the well known commutator representation of (SDYM) to the equations on the infinite dimensional Grassmann manifold. The complexified (SDYM) with the structure group GL(r,\({\mathbb{C}})\) are written in the form: (1) \(\partial_ yA_{\bar z}-\partial_{\bar z}A_{\bar y}+[A_{\bar y},A_{\bar z}]=0\), \(\partial_ yA_{\bar y}+\partial_{\bar z}A_{\bar z}=0\), where \(\partial_ u=\partial /\partial u\), \(u=y,\bar y,z,\bar z\) and \(A_ u\) denotes the \(g\ell (r,{\mathbb{C}})\) valued functions.

In der ersten der beiden vorliegenden Arbeiten vereinfacht Verf. den Grenzübergang von der Lösung des \textit{Plateau}schen Problems mit polygonaler Randkurve zur Lösung für beliebige rektifizierbare Randkurven durch den Beweis des folgenden Konvergenzsatzes:

\(\varGamma^*_n\) sei eine Folge von einfach geschlossenen Kurven im \((x,y,z)\)-Raum mit folgenden Eigenschaften: \((\alpha)\) die Längen \(l(\varGamma^*_n)\) der \(\varGamma^*_n\) sind gleichmäßig beschränkt; \((\beta)\) das \textit{Plateau}sche Problem (das in der \textit{Weierstraß}schen Form unter Bezugnahme auf isotherme Parameter aufgestellt wird) sei für jedes \(\varGamma^*_n\) lösbar (\(n = 1, 2,\dots)\); \((\gamma)\varGamma^*_n\) konvergiere im \textit{Fréchet}schen Sinne gegen eine einfach geschlossene Kurve \(\varGamma^*\). Dann ist das \textit{Plateau}sche Problem auch für \(\varGamma^*\) lösbar.

In der zweiten Arbeit zeigt Verf., daß man zu einer Lösung des \textit{Plateau}schen Problems für Polygone gelangen kann, indem man zunächst ``Approximationslösungen'' in folgendem Sinne konstruiert:

Die Lösung des \textit{Plateau}schen Problems erfordert bekanntlich die Bestimmung von drei Funktionen \(x(u, v)\), \(y(u,v)\), \(z(u,v)\), die (1) für \(u^2+v^2<1\) harmonisch sind; (2) für \(u^2+ v^2 < 1\) den Bedingungen
\[
 E = G,\quad F = 0
\]
 genügen, wobei \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), die ersten Fundamentalgrößen der Fläche sind; (3) für \(u^2+v^2\leqq 1\) stetig sind und den Kreis \(u^2 + v^2<1\) eineindeutig auf die gegebene Randkurve abbilden.

Bei einer Approximationslösung wird die Bedingung (2) durch die folgende ersetzt:
\[
 \iint|F|<\varepsilon,\qquad\iint(\sqrt{E}-\sqrt{G})^2<\varepsilon \tag{2*}
\]
 wobei die Integration über \(u^2+v^2 < 1\) zu erstrecken ist.

Bei der Bestimmung einer solchen Näherungslösung sind noch gewisse ``Randbedingungen'' willkürlich: man kann noch verlangen, daß drei willkürliche Punkte \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) in drei Punkte \(A^*\), \(B^*\), \(C^*\) der gegebenen Randkurve übergehen.

Solche Näherungslösungen erhält man, indem man, ausgehend von der Annahme, daß eine Minimalfläche eine Fläche kleinsten Flächeninhalts sei, eine Folge von aus Dreiecken aufgebauten Polyedern herstellt, deren Oberfläche gegen die untere Grenze der Flächeninhalte der von dem gegebenen Randpolygon angegebenen Flächen konvergieren. Dabei ist jedes Dreieck im Raume das durch harmonische Funktionen vermittelte Bild eines (krummlinig) begrenzten Dreiecks im Einheitskreis. Die Existenz einer solchen Approximation ergibt sich aus einem allgemeinen Satz über konforme Abbildung Riemannscher Mannigfaltigkeiten (\textit{Koebe}, 1917, 1927; F. d. M. 46, 545; 53, 320-321).

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Summary: A family \(\mathcal{A}\) of \(k\)-subsets of \(\{1,2,\dots, N\}\) is a Sidon system if the sumsets \(A+B\), \(A,B\in \mathcal{A}\) are pairwise distinct.

It is known that the orientation distribution function (ODF) is used to describe the probability density of a crystallite with some orientation in SO(3). Since single crystals are anisotropic and the elastictity stiffness tensor of any crystallite in a polycrystal is orientation-dependent, the effective elastic stiffness tensor of the polycrystal depends on the orientational distribution of crystallites in the polycrystal. In this paper, the ergodic hypothesis is employed (i. e. the volume averages of stress, strain, elastic stiffness tensor of a polycrystal are equivalent to their corresponding ensemble). The author derives simple expression for effective stiffness tensor with quadratic texture dependence by the perturbation method. Decomposing the stress, strain and displacement fields, and also stiffness tensor into their ensemble average parts and perturbation parts, the author gives a formula for the perturbation displacement field, in which Green's function of an orthorhombic aggregate of cubic crystallites is included, and then derives a formula for effective stiffness tensors with quadratic texture dependence. For Voigt and Reuss' models, and Man theory, the information on the relevant microstructure is restricted to the ODF of a polycrystal. The author finds that this restriction is valid if the orientations of all crystallites in a polycrystal are uncorrelated and any crystallite orientation is unrelated to its shape and size, otherwise the effect of the \(n\)-point orientation correlation function to effective stiffness tensor is included. Also, the author considers the effect of grain shapes on effective elastic stiffness tensors of polycrystals. Numerical examples relate to copper, steel and aluminum crystals.",0

This is because it not only provides some additional information about the intersection pairing in the cohomology ring, which may be useful in particular contexts, but also allows some interesting applications that, quite amazingly, provide new proofs of some other great theorems established during the past five years.\n\n\nThe first application is another proof of the Verlinde formulas for the dimensions of the spaces of generalized theta functions on \\({\\mathcal N}^-_g\\) and \\({\\mathcal N}^+_g\\). The author's proof is, compared to the earlier ones given by Bertram-Szenes (1993), Beauville-Laszlo (1993), Narasimhan-Ramadas (1993), Thaddeus (1994), and Faltings (1994), obtained by a much more direct and computational method which, by its own, is based upon the very explicit enumerative geometry of \\({\\mathcal N}^\\pm_g\\) calculated before.\n\n\nFurther important applications concern three former conjectures of \\textit{P. E. Newstead} [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 169, 337-345 (1972; Zbl 0256.14008)] on the Chern classes of the tangent bundle on \\({\\mathcal N}^-_g\\). Although those conjectures of Newstead have been affirmatively answered, in the meantime, namely by D. Gieseker (1984), Thaddeus (1994), and F. Kirwan (1992; loc. cit.), the author's new proofs are (again) very direct and explicitly derived from the structure theory of \\(H^* ({\\mathcal N}^-_g, \\mathbb{Q})\\).\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0827.00037].",1

Let us think of the affine plane \\(\\mathbb A^2\\) as the algebraic variety with coordinate ring \\(k[Y,X]\\) and the affine line \\(\\mathbb A^1\\) as the algebraic variety with coordinate ring \\(k[Z]\\). (If \\(k\\) is algebraically closed it is safe to think \\(k^2\\) and \\(k\\).) Then the zero-set \\(C_1\\) of the polynomial \\(Y\\) is a closed subvariety of \\(\\mathbb A^2\\) isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb A^1\\), and so is the zero-set \\(C_2\\) of the (non-linear) polynomial \\(Y+X^2\\). Here we obviously have an automorphism of \\(\\mathbb A^2\\) that sends \\(C_2\\) to \\(C_1\\), and it is natural to\nask whether this is always the case. Along the way it is natural to\ninquire about the nature of the group of all automorphisms of \\(\\mathbb A^2\\).\n\nThe paper ``Embeddings of the line in the plane'' by S. S. Abhyankar and T.-T. Moh [AM1] deals with these questions. For reasons that will become clear, it is usually called the ``Epimorphism Paper''. The earlier paper,\n``Newton-Puiseux expansion and generalized Tschirnhausen transformation'' [AM2] will be termed the ``Expansions Paper''. It gives a comprehensive treatment, very novel at the time, of ``plane curves with one place at infinity''. It is an essential predecessor to [AM1] and has found far reaching other applications, such as the Jacobian problem, for instance. Both papers were very influential.\n\nMany of the topics of this review were intensely discussed in Abhyankar's circle during the SÃ©minaire de MathÃ©matiques SupÃ©rieures of 1970 at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. The SÃ©minaire is vividly remembered by the participants for the great intellectual ferment surrounding it, mathematical and otherwise. The lecturers were Shreeram Abhyankar, Michael Artin, Alexandre Grothendieck and Masayoshi Nagata. This was a time of great abstraction in Algebraic Geometry, but also a time of newly heightened interest in concrete and seemingly elementary problems, some very famous for being as hard to solve as easy to formulate.\n\nBoth the ``Jacobian Problem'' and the ``Lines in the Plane Problem'' belong in that class. For the lines it was accepted that the case of ``one characteristic pair'' (relatively prime \\(X\\)- and \\(Y\\)-degrees) was doable, and Oscar Zariski had suggested to Abhyankar that the case of bi-degrees having a prime GCD, or a bit more generally, those with ``two characteristic pairs'', be seriously considered. The brilliant full solution coming soon after, not only settled a fundamental mathematical problem, but it also led to a veritable explosion in related research activity. The result clearly fascinated a large number of mathematicians. Many additional proofs were published with techniques from topology, algebraic surface theory, complex variables, alternate arrangements bypassing or modifying the Newton-Puiseux expansions of [AM2], and so on. Some of these are mentioned below\nwhen needed as a reference, but we did not try to present a full list. Of course, all alternate proofs are valuable and may lead to new developments. The interested reader can easily locate variant proofs by a simple data base search.\n\nShreeram Abhyankar was our friend, guru, mentor and teacher. We dedicate this review to his inspiring mathematical career.\n\n\\textsc{The Epimorphism Paper}\n\nLet \\(k\\) be a field of characteristic \\(\\pi\\) and let \\(X, Y, Z\\) be indeterminates over \\(k\\).\n\n\\textbf{Main Theorem.} \\textit{Let \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) be non-constant polynomials of degree \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in \\(Z\\) with\ncoefficients in \\(k\\). Assume that \\(k[Z]=k[u,v]\\). Assume also that either \\(m\\) or \\(n\\) is not divisible by\n\\(\\pi\\). Then either \\(m\\) divides \\(n\\) or \\(n\\) divides \\(m\\).}\n\nWe will also describe the conclusion of the theorem by the phrase ``\\((m,n)\\) is principal''.\n\nUsing the theorem, we can deduce that if \\(m \\geq n\\) there is a \\(c\\in k\\) so that \\(u'=u-cv^{m/n} \\in k[Z]\\) with \\(\\deg(u')<\\deg(u)\\). Clearly \\(k[Z]=k[u',v]\\). If \\(m<n\\), then we find \\(c\\) so that \\(k[Z]=k[u, v'], v'=v-cu^{n/m}, \\deg(v') <\\deg(v)\\). By induction on \\(\\deg(u)+\\deg(v)\\), this gives the\n\n\\textbf{Epimorphism Theorem.} \\textit{Let \\(\\gamma: k[Y,X] \\rightarrow k[Z]\\) be the \\(k\\)-epimorphism with \\(\\gamma(X)=0\\) and \\(\\gamma(Y)=Z\\). Let \\(\\alpha: k[Y,X] \\rightarrow k[Z]\\) be any \\(k\\)-epimorphism such that at least one of \\(\\deg_Z\\alpha(X)\\) and \\(\\deg_Z\\alpha(Y)\\) is not divisible by \\(\\pi\\).\nThen there exists an automorphism \\(\\delta: k[Y,X] \\rightarrow k[Y,X]\\) such that \\(\\gamma=\\alpha \\delta\\).}\n\nCall an automorphism \\(\\tau:k[Y,X] \\rightarrow k[Y,X]\\) \\textit{elementary} if \\(\\tau(Y,X)=(X,Y)\\) or \\(\\tau(Y,X) = (bY+f(X),aX)\\) where \\(f(X)\\in k[X]\\) and \\(a,b\\in k\\) are non zero.\nCall \\(\\tau\\) \\textit{tame}, if it is a composite of elementary automorphisms.\n\nIt is then deduced that:\n\n\\textbf{Addendum to the Epimorphism Theorem.} \\textit{\\(\\delta\\) can be chosen to be a tame automorphism.}\n\nThe following lemma is crucial in linking the epimorphism problem to the expansion techniques of the earlier paper [AM2]. In [AM1] it is given a very elementary treatment in the spirit of High School Algebra. It will reappear later in a more sophisticated form in a general discussion of plane curves with one place at infinity.\n\nWe will call a polynomial \\(F(Y,X)\\) pre-monic in \\(Y\\) of degree \\(n\\) if \\(F(Y,X)=a_0Y^n+a_1Y^{n-1}+\\cdots \\in k[X][Y]\\) with \\(0\\neq a_0\\in k\\).\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} \\textit{Let \\(u\\in k[Z]\\) be of \\(Z\\)-degree \\(n>0\\). Let \\(v\\in k[Z]\\) be such that \\(k[Z]=k[u,v]\\). Let \\(\\alpha: k[Y,X]\\rightarrow k[Z]\\) be the \\(k\\) homomorphism with \\(\\alpha(Y)=v\\) and \\(\\alpha(X)=u\\). Then a generator \\(F(Y,X)\\) of \\(Ker(\\alpha)\\) is pre-monic of degree \\(n\\) in \\(Y\\) and irreducible in \\(k((X^{-1}))[Y]\\). This is also described as, \\(F(Y,X)\\) is a curve with one rational place at infinity.}\n\nWe can, of course, choose \\(F\\) to be monic in \\(Y\\), but let us note that unless \\(v=0\\) and hence \\(\\deg(u)=1\\),\n\\(F\\) is also pre-monic in \\(X\\) of some degree \\(m\\geq 0\\).\n\nThe following is a more geometric, and equivalent, version of the Epimorphism Theorem. It explains the title of the Epimorphism Paper.\n\n\\textbf{Embedding Theorem.} \\textit{Let \\(C\\) be a closed curve in the affine plane \\(\\mathbb A^2_k=\\mathrm{Spec}(k[Y,X])\\). Assume that \\(C\\) is biregularly isomorphic to the affine line \\(\\mathbb A^1_k=\\mathrm{Spec}(k[Z])\\). Let \\(F\\) be a generator of its ideal in \\(k[Y,X]\\) and assume that either \\(\\deg_YF\\) or \\(\\deg_XF\\) is not divisible by \\(\\pi\\). Then \\(F\\) is a \\textit{variable} in \\(k[Y,X]\\), i.e., there exists \\(G\\in k[Y,X]\\) such that \\(k[Y,X]=k[F,G]\\). Moreover, the automorphism \\(\\delta:k[Y,X]\\rightarrow k[Y,X]\\) defined by \\(\\delta(Y)=F, \\delta(X)=G\\) is tame.}\n\nThe first counterexample to the above theorems in case \\(\\pi>0\\) and the gcd of \\(\\deg_YF\\) and \\( \\deg_XF\\) is divisible by \\(\\pi\\) was, to our knowledge, given by B. Segre in [Se].\nAbhyankar and Moh give a family of counterexamples of the same type. Let us describe the simplest one:\n\nConsider \\(u=Z-Z^{r\\pi}\\) and \\(v=Z^{\\pi^2}\\) in \\(k[Z]\\). Then \\(Z=u+(u^{\\pi}+v^r)^r\\). Let \\(\\alpha: k[Y,X]\\rightarrow k[Z]\\) be the \\(k\\) homomorphism with \\(\\alpha(Y)=v\\) and \\(\\alpha(X)=u\\). Then \\(F(Y,X)=Y^{r\\pi}-Y+X^{\\pi^2}\\) is a generator of \\(Ker(\\alpha)\\), which is monic in \\(Y\\).\nTaking \\(r>1\\) and prime to \\(\\pi\\) we have a counterexample to the Main Theorem.\n\nInterest in the automorphism group of \\(k[Y,X]\\) is older than the above results. We have the following theorem, proved by H. W. E. Jung in 1942 [J] for \\(\\pi=0\\) and by W. van der Kulk in general in 1953 [VdK]. It can now be deduced from the embedding theorem when \\(\\pi=0\\).\n\n\\textbf{Automorphism Theorem.} \\textit{Any automorphism of \\(k[Y,X]\\) is tame.}\n\nVan der Kulk also proves a uniqueness theorem for the decomposition of a given automorphism into elementary ones. This was further elaborated by M. Nagata in [Na2].\n\nIn a letter dated 25 April 1971, at the time the news of the solution of the epimorphism problem first spread, Abhyankar was informed by G.M. Bergman that as a consequence of the commutative result the epimorphism theorem also holds in the non-commutative case. We have\n\n\\textbf{Non-Commutative Epimorphism Theorem.} \\textit{Let \\(k\\langle X,Y \\rangle\\) and \\(k\\langle Z \\rangle =k[Z]\\) be the free associative algebras. Then the Epimorphism Theorem holds with \\(k\\langle X,Y \\rangle\\) and \\(k\\langle Z \\rangle\\) replacing \\(k[Y,X]\\) an \\(k[Z]\\).}\n\n\\textsc{The Expansions Paper}\n\n\\textsl{Curves with One Place at Infinity} \n\nA place at infinity of an affine irreducible curve with coordinate ring \\(A\\) and function field \\(K\\) is a valuation ring \\(V\\) of \\(K/k\\) which does not contain \\({A}\\).\n\nWe say that \\(A\\) has one place at infinity if there is exactly one place at infinity and moreover the residue field of the valuation ring coincides with \\(k\\), in other words, the valuation is ``residually rational''. Important examples are what Abhyankar called \\textbf{polynomial curves}, i.e., curves parametrized by polynomials in one variable.\n\nFor a curve defined by a polynomial \\(F(Y,X)\\in k[Y,X]\\) a place at infinity is concretely described by what Abhyankar, tongue in cheek, called Newton's theorem on Puiseux expansions, or ``meromorphic branches'' of \\(F(Y,X)\\). We will call them Newton-Puiseux (NP) expansions. These are substitutions \\((X,Y)=(\\tau^{-n}, \\eta(\\tau))\\), where \\(\\eta(\\tau) \\in k^*((\\tau))\\) and (i) \\(F(\\eta(\\tau),\\tau^{-n})=0\\), (ii) \\(k^*\\) is a finite algebraic extension of \\(k\\) and (iii) \\(n\\) is not divisible by the characteristic the gcd of \\(n\\) and the support of \\(\\eta(\\tau)\\) is \\(1\\). This defines the valuation ring \\(V\\) consisting of all rational functions \\(g(Y,X)\\) for which \\(\\mathrm{ord}_{\\tau}g(\\eta(\\tau),\\tau^{-n})\\geq 0\\).\n\nFor a plane curve defined by \\(F(Y,X)\\) with, say, \\(\\deg_Y F(Y,X)\\) not divisible by the characteristic, it can be deduced that it has one rational place at infinity (sometimes shortened to just ``\\(F\\) is a one place curve''), if and only if it has an NP expansion with \\(k^*=k\\) and \\(n=\\deg_YF(Y,X)\\).\n\nNote that a polynomial \\(F\\) with one place at infinity is irreducible in \\(k[Y,X]\\) and irreducible as well in the larger ring \\(k((X^{-1}))[Y]\\).\nIt can be shown that \\(F\\) is pre-monic in any choice of variables (which are not absent from \\(F\\)). In particular, the above equivalence is not dependent on our choice of coordinates, up to possibly switching of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). \\textbf{For simplicity we will assume hereafter that \\(F(Y,X)\\) is monic in \\(Y\\) and \\(\\pi\\nmid n=\\deg_YF\\).}\n\nIt is a classic procedure to associate certain ``characteristic sequences'' to elements of \\(k[[\\tau]]\\). The basic tool in [AM2] is a certain clever reorganization invented by Abhyankar of such sequences associated to any \\textbf{meromorphic power series} \\(\\eta(\\tau) \\in k((\\tau))\\). Abhyankar used to relate that he recorded several ideas about plane curves in his personal notes of Zariski's lectures on curves, but always presumed that he had simply learned them in Zariski's course. He discovered that they were his own inventions only when Zariski was not aware of them. His idea of introducing the \\(q\\)-sequence, for instance, made the complicated formulas involved in manipulating Newton-Puiseux expansions into much simpler statements of invariance. He wrote two separate papers entitled Inversion and Invariance of Characteristic Pairs exploring the power of these techniques.\n\nFollowing [A] 6.4, we give a brief outline. Let \\(\\eta(\\tau) \\in k((\\tau))\\) and \\(n\\in \\mathbb N\\) be given.\nLet \\(J\\) be the support of \\(\\eta(\\tau)\\) and assume that the gcd of \\(J\\) with \\(n\\) is \\(1\\).\n\nStart with \\(m_1=\\min(J)\\) and \\(d_1=n\\). Set \\(d_2=\\gcd(m_1,d_1)\\).\nDefine \\(m_2\\) as the first element of \\(J\\) not divisible by \\(d_2\\). Set \\(d_3=\\gcd(m_2,d_2)\\).\nContinue until \\(d_{h+1}=1\\) (since then no \\(m_{h+1}\\) can be found).\n\nThis \\textbf{m-sequence} marks the places of gcd-drops in \\(J\\) and the \\textbf{d-sequence} gives the successive gcd's.\n\nA sequence equivalent to the \\(m\\)-sequence, but more useful, is the \\textbf{q-sequence} defined by \\(q_1=m_1\\) and \\(q_{i+1}=m_{i+1}-m_i\\) thereafter.\n\nWe define the \\textbf{s-sequence} and \\textbf{r-sequence} by \\(s_i = \\sum_{j=1}^i q_j d_j \\) and \\(r_i=s_i/d_i\\). These play a crucial role in computing intersection numbers, as exemplified by the following kind of computation which plays an important role in the Abhyankar-Moh theory:\n\nConsider \\textbf{a deformed initial part} of the series \\(\\eta(\\tau)\\), namely \\(u(\\tau) = c_1\\tau^{m_1}+\\cdots + Z\\tau^{m_i}\\), agreeing with \\(\\eta(\\tau)\\) in all terms preceding \\(\\tau^{m_i}\\) and with \\(Z\\) an indeterminate.\nThen it is easy to calculate that the initial term of the product \\(\\prod_\\omega \\left(u(\\tau)-\\eta(\\omega\\tau)\\right)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) ranges over the \\(n\\)-th roots of unity, is of the form \\(c(Z)\\tau^{s_i}\\), where \\(c(Z)\\) is a non-zero polynomial in \\(Z\\).\n\nWhere necessary, we will indicate the dependence on \\(\\eta\\) and \\(n\\) in these definitions by a suitable notation.\n\nNote that each of the \\(m\\)-, \\(q\\)- and \\(r\\)-sequence have the associated \\(d\\)-sequence as sequence of successive gcd's.\n\n\\textsl{One Place and Expansions}\n\nLet \\(F(Y,X)\\) be a one place curve with NP expansion \\((X,Y)=(\\tau^{-n}, \\eta(\\tau))\\).\nWe get the well-known induced factorization \\(F(Y,\\tau^{-n}) = \\prod_{j=1}^n (Y-\\eta(\\omega^j\\tau)) \\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive \\(n\\)-th root of unity.\nIn particular, all roots of \\(F(Y,\\tau^{-n})\\) have the same support and the characteristic sequences we defined depend on \\(F\\) only. We note that \\(m_1(-n,\\eta(\\tau))=-\\deg_XF(Y,X)\\).\n\nWe mention two essential ingredients of the Abhyankar-Moh theory which are responsible for most of its successes.\n\n{\\parindent=6mm\n\\begin{itemize}\\item[1.]\n{\\textbf{The Irreducibility Criterion of Abhyankar and Moh.} \\textit{Assume that \\(n=\\deg_{Y} {F(Y,X)}\\not\\equiv 0 \\mod{\\pi}\\) and \\(F(Y,X)\\) is monic in \\(Y\\).

In geometric language, this means that \\(F\\) and \\(F+\\lambda\\) go through each other at infinity at all the singular points in a sequence of quadratic transforms.}\n\nThis is deduced from the irreducibility lemma and the explicit calculation of the initial forms in terms of the approximate roots. Over \\(\\mathbb C\\) it implies that the fibration defined by \\(F\\) is topologically trivial in a neighborhood of infinity.\n\n\\textsl{The Value Semigroup of a One Place Curve, Standard Basis}\n\nLet \\(F(Y,X)\\) and have one place at infinity with NP expansion \\((X,Y)=(\\tau^{-n}, \\eta(\\tau))\\) and coordinate ring \\(A=k[Y,X]/(F(Y,X))\\). Let \\(\\alpha:k[Y,X]\\rightarrow k[y,x]=A\\) be the canonical homomorphism with \\(\\alpha(X)=x, \\alpha(Y)=y\\). The valuation \\(V\\) at infinity on the quotient field of \\(A\\) is defined by \\(V(h(y,x))= \\mathrm{ord}_{\\tau}h(\\eta(\\tau),\\tau^{-n})\\). We define the \\textbf{value semigroup of \\(F\\)} as\n\\(\\Gamma_F = \\{ V(h) ~|~ 0\\neq h\\in A\\}\\). Define \\(g_0=x\\) and put \\(r_0=V(x)=-n\\). For \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\) let \\(g_i=\\alpha(G_i)\\), where the \\(G_i\\) are the approximate roots introduced above and, as\nwe said, \\(V(g_i)=r_i\\). Let \\(\\mathfrak A\\) be the set of \\((h+1)\\)-tuples \\(a=(a_0,a_1,\\dots, a_h)\\) of integers with \\(a_0 \\geq 0\\) and \\(0\\leq a_i < d_i/d_{i+1} \\) for \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,h\\). The following results are the technical core of the Abhyankar-Moh theory:\n{\\parindent=6mm\n\\begin{itemize}\\item[-] \\(\\Gamma_F=\\{a_0 r_0 + a_1r_1 + \\dots +a_h r_h| (a_0, \\dots, a_h)\\in \\mathfrak A\\}\\).

Note that in each linear combination over \\(k\\) of standard monomials\nthere is a unique term whose valuation at infinity is the valuation of the sum.\n\n\n\\end{itemize}}\n\nIt can be deduced from the above that \\textit{if \\(d_2\\) belongs to \\(\\Gamma_F\\), then \\((r_0,r_1)\\) is principal and hence one of \\(m,n\\) divides the other}. We obtain a \\textbf{proof of the Epimorphism Theorem} since in that case \\(\\Gamma_F\\) is \\(\\{0,1,2,\\dots \\}\\).\n\nWe remark that expansion techniques can also be applied to irreducible elements \\(F(U,V)\\) of the power series ring \\(k[[U,V]]\\), in particular when it is the completion of of the local ring at the point at infinity in \\(\\mathbb P^2\\) of a one-place curve. If one does not insist that the expansion be of NP type (with one of the variables a power of the parameter \\(\\tau\\)), the basic definitions can be made without explicit reference to the characteristic \\(\\pi\\). This is useful in some applications, see [Ru3].\n\n\\textsc{Suzuki's Proof}\nA proof of the Embedding Theorem contemporary with that of Abhyankar and Moh was given by M. Suzuki [Su]. It is very different in spirit, and the Embedding Theorem nowadays is often cited as the \\textbf{AMS-Theorem.} Suzuki's paper also was very influential. It uses methods of complex analysis, in particular the theory of pluri-subharmonic functions, to study polynomial maps \\(F: \\mathbb C^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb C\\), where \\(F\\) is an irreducible polynomial. A key result, now usually referred to as Suzuki's formula, is that the topological Euler characteristic of any singular (special) fiber is at least as big as that of a regular (general) fiber.\n(This generalizes a fact well known in the case of proper maps.) In case \\(F_0=F^{-1}(0)\\simeq \\mathbb C\\), Suzuki then goes on to show that \\(F_0\\) is in fact a regular fiber. His methods apply to morphisms \\(\\Phi:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb C\\) for surfaces more general than \\(\\mathbb C^2\\), in particular all smooth affine surfaces. His results have been extended and sharpened by M. Zaidenberg [Za], and a proof of Suzuki's formula relying on\ngeometric methods rather than complex analysis, or, let us say, more accessible to algebraic geometers, has been given by R. Gurjar [Gu2].\n\n\\textsc{Positive Characteristic}\nThe counterexamples to the Embedding Theorem in positive characteristic \\(\\pi\\) cited above left open the question whether at least the ``One Place Theorem'' (see 3.2) still holds. This question was raised by Abhyankar in\n[A]. A partially positive, partially negative answer was given by R. Ganong [Ga1]. For simplicity we assume that \\(k\\) is algebraically closed.\n\n\\textbf{The Generic One Place Theorem.} \\textit{Let \\(F\\in k[Y,X]\\) have one place at infinity. Then the generic member \\(F-t\\), \\(t\\) transcendental over \\(k\\), of the pencil \\(F-\\lambda, \\lambda \\in k\\), has one place at infinity with residue field purely inseparable over \\(k(t)\\). Moreover, for almost all \\(\\lambda \\in k\\), \\(F-\\lambda\\) has one place at infinity with multiplicity sequence at infinity the same as that of \\(F-t\\) over the algebraic closure of \\(k(t)\\).}\n\nThis is a ``best possible'' result: Ganong also gives examples of one place curves \\(F\\) with with a special member having more than one place at infinity, or with general member having a multiplicity sequence at infinity different from that of \\(F\\). Following the lead of M. Nagata [Na1] and M. Miyanishi [Mi1], Ganong investigates special properties of the pencil obtained by eliminating the base points at infinity of the pencil \\(F-\\lambda\\).\nHere the fiber at infinity is simply connected (it is a tree of curves isomorphic to the projective line), and a key result is a positive characteristic version of a lemma of Kodaira [Kod] on the global multiplicity of such fibers. We remark that in case the place at infinity of \\(F-t\\) is rational over \\(k(t)\\) (i.e., the residue field is \\(k(t)\\), e.g., if \\(\\pi =0\\)), then all \\(F-\\lambda\\) have the same multiplicity sequence and the same infinitely near multiple points at\ninfinity. In particular, the Embedding Theorem follows if \\(F\\) is a line.\n\nLines in the plane in positive characteristic are still poorly understood. Some contributions to the question have been made by [Da2, Da3, Ga1, Mo2]. The following closely related conjectures seem to have been made by several researchers. An overview of relevant results is given in [Ga3], see also [Mi2].\n\n\\textbf{Lines Conjectures in Characteristic \\(\\pi\\).}\n{\\parindent=6mm\n\\begin{itemize}\\item[i)] If \\(F\\in k[Y,X]\\) is a line, then all \\(F-\\lambda, \\lambda \\in k\\) are lines.\n\\item[ii)] If \\(F\\in k[Y,X]\\) is a line, then the relative Frobenius w.r.t. \\(F\\) is a plane, i.e., \\(k[X^{\\pi}, Y^{\\pi},F]\\) is a polynomial ring.\n\n\n\\end{itemize}}\n\n\\textsc{Further Developments from the Expansions Paper}\n\\textsl{The Jacobian Problem}\nInspired by their new machinery, Abhyankar and Moh produced independently several papers attacking the famous\n\\textbf{Jacobian Problem}. In dimension two, it asks if polynomials \\(f_1,f_2\\) in the polynomial ring \\(k[X,Y]\\) over a field \\(k\\) of characteristic zero with Jacobian determinant \\(1\\) generate \\(k[X,Y]\\).\n\nIndeed, this problem was rejuvenated and popularized by Abhyankar along with several other problems in Affine Geometry of two and three dimensions as a way to attract new students to important but accessible problems in Algebraic Geometry.\n\nAbhyankar and Moh propose to consider \\(f_1,f_2\\) as elements of \\(k(X)[Y]\\), that is as defining a \\textbf{polynomial curve} over \\(k(X)\\) with \\(Y\\) serving as parameter, see [A] for details. They quickly translated the Jacobian condition into conditions on the resulting NP expansion and produced the following striking result, among others:\n\n\\textbf{The Two Point Theorem.} \\textit{The Jacobian condition implies that \\(f_1,f_2\\) have at most two points at infinity, i.e., their top degree forms in \\(X,Y\\) have at most two non-associate factors.\nMoreover, \\textbf{if it can be deduced} that the Jacobian condition implies that \\(f_1,f_2\\) have at most one point at infinity, then the Jacobian problem has an affirmative answer.}\n\nFor brevity, we stop here, but the problem has a long colorful history and many results (even in higher dimensions) are available at the touch of a key stroke!\n\n\\textsl{Finiteness of Embeddings of One Place Curves}\nOne way of stating the epimorphism theorem is to say that there is only one equivalence class of embeddings of an affine line in the affine plane up to automorphisms of the plane. Abhyankar raised the corresponding question for general one place curves:\nSuppose that \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) are two epimorphisms from \\(k[Y,X]\\) onto the coordinate ring \\(A\\) of a plane curve with one rational place at infinity.\nDoes it follow that \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are equivalent? If not, is it at least true that the number of equivalence classes is finite?\n\nLet \\(F\\) be a generator of \\(\\ker(\\alpha)\\), say. We can then arrange by an automorphism of \\(k[X,Y]\\) that \\((r_0,r_1)=(-\\deg_YF, -\\deg_XF)\\) is non-principal. This gives that \\(d_2=\\gcd(r_0,r_1)\\) is a number not in the value semigroup, by the non principal condition (see 3.3). In [ASi] Abhyankar and Singh prove the following striking result:\n\\textit{Two embeddings are equivalent if and only if the corresponding \\(d_2\\)'s are equal.}\nThis, combined with the fact that there are only finitely many negative numbers not in the value-semigroup, gives the finiteness of embeddings with a very explicit bound on the number. (We have tacitly assumed \\(\\pi=0\\). Otherwise even the line has infinitely many inequivalent embeddings [Ga1].)\n\n\\textsl{Planar Semigroups}\nThe properties of the \\textbf{characteristic \\(r\\)-sequence} in the Abhyankar-Moh theory can be codified abstractly and semigroups generated by an \\(r\\)-sequence as in 3.3 have been called \\textbf{planar semigroups} by Sathaye. (Sathaye actually preferred to work with the negative of an \\(r\\)-sequence.) It was announced in [Sa2] and shown in\n[SS] that every planar semi-group is the value semi-group of a one place curve. See [A2] as well. The irreducibility criterion 3.2.1 plays a significant role here.\n\nAn important question, originally raised by Abhyankar himself, is to characterize the semi-groups at infinity, or equivalently the degree semigroups, of \\textit{plane polynomial curves.}\nThis remains unsolved to date. For further calculations and conjectures about these, see [SS], [SFY] and [M-L]. An interesting special case is the \\textbf{Lin-Zaidenberg Theorem} [LZ] which asserts that there is only one class for polynomial curves with only unibranch singularities. (The theorem proves more, namely that such curves have only one quasi-homogeneous singularity and that \\(d_2=1\\).)\n\n\\textsc{A Sampling of Further Related Results}\nThe Epimorphism Theorem inspired a large amount of research on related questions. We can only give a brief sampling. Coefficient rings more general than fields were considered [Ba], [RS], [Ve]. More general closed embeddings of affine \\(m\\)-space \\(\\mathbb A^m\\) in affine \\(n\\)-space \\(\\mathbb A^n\\) were studied [Kal1], [Sr]. Abhyankar in particular advocated the study of embeddings of lines and planes in affine \\(3\\)-space. For some results on lines see [A3], [AS], [Cr], [BR], [Sh], and for planes see [Sa1], [Ru2], [Wr], [San]. These papers depend in a crucial way on the Epimorphism Theorem. An unexpected generalization of the Epimorphism Theorem was developed by Sathaye in [Sa3], [Sa4] and [Sa5].\nIt became an important tool in several studies of \\(\\mathbb A^2\\)-fibrations over curves.\nThe Epimorphism Theorem also is the essential ingredient in the proof of a special case of the linearization conjecture for \\(\\mathbb C^*\\)-actions on \\(\\mathbb C^3\\), see [KKM-LR].\n\nIt was a suggestion coming out of Abhyankar's Purdue seminar to consider closed curves in the affine plane with several places at infinity. A once punctured affine line, \\(\\mathbb C^*\\) when \\(k=\\mathbb C\\), is the obvious first candidate, see [BZ], [C-NKR], [Kal2], [Ko2] for results in this case. Another suggestion was to investigate ``field generators'' (instead ``ring generators'' as in the Epimorphism Theorem), that is, \\textit{polynomials \\(F\\) that together with a complementary rational function \\(G\\) generate the field \\(k(X,Y)\\)}, see [Ja], [NN], [MS],\n[Ru1], [Da1].\n\nThe Epimorphism Theorem gave a strong boost to \\textit{Affine Algebraic Geometry,} the study of algebraic varieties closely related to affine spaces, in particular affine rational surfaces. The study of affine lines on such surfaces became an important part of their classification via logarithmic Kodaira dimension [It], [GMMR], [GM1], [KK]. In turn, the classification theory has been used to prove the Epimorphism Theorem [GM2], [Gu1], [Ko1].\n\n\\textsc{Bibliography}\n\n\n [A] S. S.

The problem investigated is to find conditions such that \(\pi\) biharmonic implies \(\pi\) harmonic.

The first theorem proved is that if the principal \(G\)-bundle is compact and has non-positive Ricci curvature then \(\pi\) biharmonic implies \(\pi\) harmonic. The reader will notice in the proof that the one-form \(\alpha\) defined by Equation (3.7) is not quite well-defined on the base manifold unless the tension field of \(\pi\) is actually basic. This should then be compared with [\textit{C. Oniciuc}, An. Ştiinţ. Univ. Al. I. Cuza Iaşi, Ser. Nouă, Mat. 48, No. 2, 237--248 (2002; Zbl 1061.58015)].

The second set of conditions is to assume the principal \(G\)-bundle is non-compact complete with non-positive Ricci curvature and the energy and bienergy of \(\pi\) are finite. Then \(\pi\) biharmonic implies \(\pi\) harmonic. The proof of this second theorem is really only a rehash of \textit{N. Nakauchi} et al. [Geom. Dedicata 169, 263--272 (2014; Zbl 1316.58012)].",0

1700879,"Toric varieties often provide an excellent class of examples in the study of complicated questions in algebraic geometry. On the one hand, due to their correspondence to fans, many questions can be reduced to completely combinatorial properties, on the other hand, they represent an ample cross-section of all varieties.

In the first part, these class is described in combinatorial terms, and it it shown that such a variety is always an iterated blow-up of a product of projective spaces. The second part gives the proof of the quantum Giambelli formula in this situation.

D. thesis ``A Formula for the Gromov-Witten Invariants of Toric Varieties'' (UniversitÃ© Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, 1999; Zbl 0964.14045), the author of the present paper has recently proven an explicit combinatorial formula for the genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth projective toric variety \\(X\\) with respect to the distinguished cohomology class \\(\\beta = 1\\) in \\(H^0(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{0,m},\\mathbb{Q})\\), where \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{0,m}\\) denotes the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of genus-zero curves with \\(m\\) marked points.\n\n\nIn the paper under review, the author continues this study by deriving a similar formula for the case where the class \\(\\beta\\) is the maximal product of Chern classes of cotangent lines to the marked points, that is for those classes that are PoincarÃ© dual to a finite number of points in the moduli space \\(\\overline{M}_{0,m}\\).

The fractional-order flow field derivative is also used in the smoothing constraint equation. The Euler-Lagrange equation is utilized for the minimization of the energy function of the fractional-order optical flow model. Two-dimensional fractional differential masks are proposed and applied to the calculation of the model simplification. Considering the spatiotemporal memory property of fractional-order, the algorithm preserves the edge discontinuity of the optical flow field while improving the accuracy of the estimation of the dense optical flow field.

In view of the well-known correspondence between globally generated vector bundles and maps to Grassmannians, we obtain, as a corollary, a classification of double Veronese embeddings of \\(\\mathbb P^n\\) into a Grassmannian \\(\\mathbb G(k-1,N)\\) of \\((k - 1)\\)-planes in \\(\\mathbb P^N\\).",The author has given a new proof of global existence for the coupled Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in one-space dimension.

1605281,"Let \\(A\\) be a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field and suppose there exists a simple projective \\(A\\)-module \\(S\\). Let \\(\\widehat P\\) be the sum of one copy of each indecomposable projective module not isomorphic to \\(S\\). The module \\(T=\\tau_A^{-1}S\\oplus\\widehat P\\), where \\(\\tau_A\\) denotes the Auslander-Reiten translation, is called an APR-tilting module. Dually, by using a simple injective module, one can define an APR-cotilting module. There are nice categorical relations between the algebras \\(A\\) and \\(B=\\text{End }T\\), when \\(T\\) is an APR-(co)tilting module and this enables one to transfer informations from \\(\\text{mod }A\\) to \\(\\text{mod }B\\). So, it is interesting to know, for a well-known class of algebras, which algebras can be reached by an iteration of the above process of taking endomorphism rings of APR-(co)tilting modules. The main result here is that each derived tubular algebra can be transformed by a finite sequence of APR-tilts or APR-cotilts to a canonical algebra. This is no longer true if one starts with an algebra which is derived equivalent to a canonical algebra of domestic type.","Let \\({\\mathbf X}\\) be a weighted projective line of genus one and \\(\\Lambda\\) be its canonical module. The authors develop an approach [see \\textit{W. Geigle} and \\textit{H. Lenzing}, Lect. Notes Math. 1273, 265-297 (1987; Zbl 0651.14006)] to the classification problem of indecomposable vector bundles on \\(\\mathbf X\\). In fact, this problem is closely connected with the classification of vector bundles on an elliptic curve \\({\\mathbf T}\\) and the classification of finite dimensional modules over \\(\\Lambda\\). In particular, it is proved that all these classifications have much in common although there are some differences. For example, the Grothendieck group \\(K_ 0({\\mathbf T})\\) has infinite rank while \\(K_ 0({\\mathbf X}) = K_ 0 (\\Lambda)\\) is free abelian of finite rank, the line bundles of degree zero on \\({\\mathbf T}\\) form a 1-parameter family while \\({\\mathbf X}\\) has only finitely many line bundles of degree zero, and so on.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0786.00022].",1

The spectral problem \(Lu=\lambda Bu\) is considered in an interpolation scale of Hilbert spaces \(H_ s\) (\(s\in[-1,1]\)), associated with this problem, where \(H_ 1\) is the form domain of the Friedrichs extension of \(L\) and \(H_ 1\) is embedded in \(H_{-1}\). Under an appropriate positivity assumption on \(L\), and compactness assumption on \(B\) and an additional assumption on the scale \(H_ s\), it is shown that the normalized eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue problem in \(H_ 1\) form a Riesz basis in the space \(H_ 0\), which is the completion of \(E\) with respect to the norm \(\| | B|^{1/2} u\|\). The abstract theory is applied to the case where \(L\) is a (possibly degenerate) elliptic operator on a bounded domain \(\Omega\) and \(B\) is the operator of multiplication by a function \(g\); the space \(E\) is \(L^ 2(\Omega)\). Both \(g\) and \(1/g\) can be unbounded; the zero set of \(g\) is assumed to be a smooth manifold of dimension \(n-1\). The verification of the assumptions from the abstract theory is only partly performed; certain assumptions reduce to embedding and compactness theorems for function spaces which are not known in the desired generality; therefore some of the assumptions on the function \(g\) and the coefficients of \(L\) are implicit. The conclusion is that the eigenfunctions form a Riesz basis in the space \(L_{| g|}^ 2\) and moreover (under certain conditions) in some weighted Sobolev spaces.",0

1144539,Summary: We present an algorithm for obtaining the matter content of effective six-dimensional theories resulting from compactification of \\(F\\)-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds which are hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The algorithm allows us to read off the matter content of the theory from the polyhedron describing the Calabi-Yau manifold. This is based on the generalized Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation condition.,"The book under review collects mathematical and physical materials presented at the Clay Mathematics Institute Spring School on Mirror Symmetry in 2000 at Pine Manor College, Brookline, Massachusetts. The book is purported to make a bridge between mathematicians and physicists working on mirror symmetry developing mutually understandable language and mutual respect. Accordingly, almost half of the book is devoted to introductory materials in mathematics and physics surrounding mirror symmetry with emphasis on the interconnection between the two fields.\n\nMirror symmetry is a phenomenon, commonly known as ``duality''. The idea of mirror symmetry has originated in physics, e.g., \\(T\\)-duality; the theory has exploded onto the mathematical scene. In the last decades, this interaction between mathematics and physics has been phenomenal.\n\nCalabi-Yau manifolds have emerged as interesting geometries for string propagation, tied with \\(N=2\\) supersymmetry. This has led to the formulation of the mirror symmetry conjecture that two seemingly different Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimension three would give rise to the isomorphic physical theory. This mirror symmetry prediction has been established for a large class of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Also mirror symmetry enables us to compute the number of rational curves on a Calabi-Yau threefold in terms of Hodge structure for the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold.\n\nThe notion of topological mirror symmetry has been introduced, among other reasons, to count the number of holomorphic maps from higher genus curves to Calabi-Yau threefolds. This is accommodated by introducing D-branes. The mirror symmetry conjecture is also formulated as the statement of the equivalence of the derived category and the Fukaya category. Toric geometry is used to construct a large class of mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n\nThe book consists of \\(40\\) chapters, divided into five parts. Part I covers chapters 1 to 7 and deals with mathematical preliminaries. Part II covers chapters 8 to 19, and aims to give physical preliminaries. Part III gives a ``physics proof'' to the mirror symmetry conjecture, and part IV (covering chapters 21 to 30) presents a mathematical proof to the mirror symmetry conjecture. Finally part V covers chapters 31 to 40 and is devoted to more advanced topics.\n\nHere is a more detailed description of each chapter. Each chapter carefully chooses materials which are essential for understanding mirror symmetry, and the treatments are often centered around specific examples.\n\nChapter 1 (Differential geometry): This chapter gives a review on the basics of differential geometry, including manifolds and submanifolds, vector bundles, differential forms and integration.\n\nChapter 2 (Algebraic geometry): This chapter outlines the very basic constructions of algebraic geometry, including projective spaces, toric geometry, the hyperplane line bundles, sheaves and cohomology, and divisors.\n\nChapter 3 (Differential and algebraic topology): This chapter contains various cohomology theories, and discussions on characteristic classes, and their applications.\n\nChapter 4 (Equivariant cohomology and fixed-point theorems): This chapter contains a synopsis of various theorems concerning the localization of calculations of fixed points of diffeomorphisms, zeros of vector fields or sections, or fixed points of group actions. The motivation stems from the calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nChapter 5 (Complex and KÃ¤hler geometry): This chapter discusses the basics of complex geometry and KÃ¤hler metrics. The discussions are motived by the fact that manifolds with KÃ¤hler metric admit the \\(N=2\\) supersymmetric sigma models crucial for formulating mirror symmetry. Also Calabi-Yau conditions are discussed.\n\nChapter 6 (Calabi-Yau manifolds and their moduli): This chapter discusses deformations of a complex structure, the moduli space of the complex structure of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and singularities and their resolutions. The discussions are centered around the example of a quintic Calabi-Yau threefold and its mirror.\n\nChapter 7 (Toric geometry for string theory): This chapter gives a thorough treatment on toric geometry for string theory, and then interpreting mirror symmetry in terms of toric geometry explaining the construction due to Batyrev.\n\nChapter 8 (What is a QFT?): This chapter serves as a ``practical guide'' introduction to the part 2 (chapters 8 to 19), Physics Preliminaries. The main aim is to introduce a quantum field theory through examples. Choose a manifold \\(M\\) of dimension \\(d\\) (with/without boundaries). Then choose objects on \\(M\\), called fields. The operation of integration over the fields is called the path-integral.\n\nChapter 9 (QFT in \\(d=0\\)): This chapter discusses zero-dimensional quantum field theories, i.e., when a manifold \\(M\\) is a point. Feynman diagrams, fermions, localization, partition functions and zero-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg theory are discussed in supersymmetric quantum field theories.\n\nChapter 10 (QFT in dimension \\(1\\): quantum mechanics): This chapter discusses one-dimensional quantum field theories (quantum mechanics) in the context of supersymmetry. In particular, supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems corresponding to maps from one-dimensional space to target spaces (which are Riemannian or KÃ¤hler manifolds). These are known as sigma models. The main focus is on supersymmetric ground states.\n\nChapter 11 (Free quantum field theories in \\(1+1\\) dimensions): This chapter discusses QFT in two dimensions, focusing mainly on free QFT. Here free refers to the fact that the action is quadratic in the field variables. In supersymmetric theories, important quantities are determined using quadratic approximation of the theory, which illustrates the pivotal role of free field theories. Also the sigma model with a circle of radius \\(R\\) as a target is an example of free theory, and a \\(T\\)-duality between the sigma model of radius \\(R\\) and that of radius \\(1/R\\) is exhibited with free theory.\n\nChapter 12 (\\(N=(2,2)\\) supersymmetry): This chapter discusses mainly supersymmetric field theories in \\(1+1\\) dimensions with four real supercharges, two with positive chirality and two with negative chirality. This is called \\(N=(2,2)\\) supersymmetry, and mirror symmetry is described for two \\(N=(2,2)\\) supersymmetric quantum field theories.\n\nChapter 13 (Nonlinear sigma models and Landau-Ginzburg models): The nonlinear sigma model on a compact connected KÃ¤hler manifold \\(M\\) with the superprepotential set to zero is considered aiming toward finding the number of supersymmetric ground states. The conclusion is that the supersymmetric ground states are in one-to-one correspondence with the harmonic forms on \\(M\\). Also the \\(T\\)-duality is shown to be a mirror symmetry analyzing supersymmetric sigma model on \\(T^2\\).\n\nChapter 14 (Renormalization group flow): This chapter discusses the most important aspects of quantum field theory, namely, the rescaling of the metric on the manifold over which the quantum field theory is defined. The target space metric is seen to change as a function of the scale. However, the superpotential in a Landau-Ginzburg model does not depend on the scale. This is the famous non-renormalization theorem, and its proof and its generalizations are presented in this chapter.\n\nChapter 15 (Linear sigma models): A class of supersymmetric gauge theories in \\(1+1\\) dimensions, called linear sigma models, is studied, and a global description of linear sigma models is provided. This model is the essential tool for the proof of mirror symmetry.\n\nChapter 16 (Chiral rings and topological field theory): The chiral rings of \\((2,2)\\) supersymmetric field theories are studied. Two important aspects of \\((2,2)\\) supersymmetry theories are: the structure of the vacuum states, and the structure of chiral fields and rings. Modified \\((2,2)\\) theories, called topological field theories are introduced. Topological fields theories coincide with ordinary \\((2,2)\\) theories on flat worldsheets, but differ from them on curved Riemann surfaces (known as ``topological twisting'') in a way of preserving half of the supersymmetries. Several classes of twisted theories are studied, and computations of the chiral rings are carried out on some examples.\n\nChapter 17 (Chiral rings and the geometry of the vacuum bundle): The operator/state correspondence in QFT relates the vacuum states and the chiral fields and rings. However, there seems to be more information in the chiral rings than in the vacuum states. This chapter explores if there is any further information in the structure of the ground states that encodes the structure of the chiral ring. This sought after information is encoded in how vacuum states vary in the full Hilbert space of the theory when the superpotential parameters are varied. The connection and metric on this vacuum bundle, and their relation to chiral rings, are described by the \\(tt^*\\) equations.\n\nChapter 18 (BPS solitons in \\(N=2\\) Landau-Ginzburg theories): This chapter discusses another example of physical quantities that depend only on the superpotential terms. The spectrum of (BPS) solitons is such an example. This connects the study of Landau-Ginzburg theories to the Picard-Lefschetz theory of vanishing cycles. Also the relation between \\(tt^*\\) geometry and BPS solutions is discussed.\n\nChapter 19 (D-branes): This chapter introduces one important piece of ingredients in the mirror symmetry theory, namely, D-branes. What are D-branes? D-branes appear when one considers sigma models for maps from Riemann surfaces with boundaries, with some natural boundary conditions. A boundary is mapped to the so-called D-brane in the target space. When the target space is a circle with radius \\(R\\), the \\(T\\)-duality symmetry (which relates \\(R\\to 1/R\\) symmetry) induces an action on D-branes exchanging D0-branes (associated to the Dirichlet boundary condition) with D1-branes (associated to Neumann boundary conditions). The mirror symmetry theory is interpreted in terms of D-branes.\n\nChapter 20 (proof of mirror symmetry): This chapter is rather short, and it presents a physical proof of mirror symmetry due to Hori and Vafa, first clarifying what is meant by ``Proof''. Then the proof is divided into three steps. Here ``proving mirror symmetry'' is referred to establishing the equivalence of two theories: a gauged linear sigma model, and a Landau-Ginzburg theory with a certain superprepotential, \\(W\\), up to \\(D\\)-term variations. When certain Landau-Ginzburg theories can be viewed as Calabi-Yau sigma models, in which case the B-ring of Landau-Ginzburg theory maps to the B-model topological ring of the Calabi-Yau. In this case, mirror symmetry maps the A-model topological amplitudes in one Calabi-Yau \\(M\\) to the B-model topological amplitudes of another Calabi-Yau \\(\\widetilde M\\). This gives rise to a relation between the Hodge numbers of the Calabi-Yau: \\(h^{p,q}(M)=h^{d-p,q}(\\widetilde M)\\) where \\(d\\) is the complex dimension of \\(M\\) and \\(\\widetilde M\\). The proof presented here is more general, i.e., it addresses also the cases where the Landau-Ginzburg theories do not correspond to sigma models on Calabi-Yau manifolds (for instance, mirrors of Fano varieties). The basic ingredient in the proof is a formulation of the sigma model in the context of the gauged linear sigma model and application of \\(T\\)-duality (\\(R\\to 1/R\\) duality) to the charged fields of the gauged linear sigma model. Then mirrors are constructed for toric varieties, and then this is generalized to hypersurfaces (or complete intersections) in toric varieties.\n\nChapter 21 (Introduction and overview): Chapters 21 to 30 introduce Gromov-Witten theory to both mathematicians and physicists. This chapter gives an overview of the forthcoming chapters. Necessary notations and conventions are set up here. For instance, \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\overline{\\Sigma}\\) stand for, respectively, nodal curves and its normalization, \\({\\mathcal M}_g,\\,\\overline{{\\mathcal M}}_g,\\, {\\mathcal M}_{g,n},\\, \\overline{{\\mathcal M}}_{g,n}\\) moduli spaces of curves, \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,\\beta)\\) moduli space of stable maps. Also the concept of Deligne-Mumford stacks is introduced.\n\nChapter 22 (Complex curves (nonsingular and nodal)): Topological surfaces are introduced as differentiable manifolds of dimension two that are oriented, compact and connected. The genus is introduced. Riemannian structure, conformal structure, almost complex structure, complex structure and finally algebraic structure on topological surfaces are introduced, and relations among them are briefly discussed. Also the Riemann-Roch theorem is stated. Complex curves with the simplest singularities, namely, nodal curves, their normalizations, and differentials on nodal curves are described. Also an interpretation of nodal curves in terms of dual graphs is presented.\n\nChapter 23 (Moduli spaces of curves): The moduli space \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\) of non-singular Riemann surfaces is defined. If \\(g>1\\), \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\) is a nonsingular Deligne-Mumford stack, and furthermore, if \\(g>2\\), it is actually an orbifold. \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\) is compactified via the Deligne-Mumford compactification, and the compactification is denoted by \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_g\\). It includes special nodal curves, the so-called stable curves. Further, compactifying the moduli space \\({\\mathcal M}_{g,n}\\) of \\(n\\)-pointed genus \\(g\\) Riemann surfaces, one obtains a compact nonsingular moduli space \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}\\), whose dimension is \\(3g-3+n\\). The boundary \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}\\setminus {\\mathcal M}_{g,n}\\) is stratified by dual graph type.\n\nChapter 24 (Moduli spaces \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,\\beta)\\) of stable maps): The moduli space of stable maps is described together with some of its properties. Let \\(X\\) be a nonsingular projective variety. A stable map is a map \\(f\\) from a pointed nodal curve to \\(X\\) such that every genus \\(0\\) contracted component of \\(\\Sigma\\) has at least three special points, and every genus \\(1\\) contracted component has at least one special point. Seven properties of the moduli space \\(\\overline {\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,\\beta)\\) are discussed, including compactness of \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,\\beta)\\) and the existence of ``evaluation maps \\(ev\\), forgetful morphisms, a universal map''. Furthermore, deformation theory of stable maps is very briefly discussed.\n\nChapter 25 (Cohomology classes on \\(\\overline {\\mathcal M}_{g,n}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,\\beta)\\)): This chapter describes certain naturally defined cohomology classes on the moduli spaces of stable maps. These include classes pulled back from \\(X\\), the classes defined by the tautological line bundles, and the classes defined by the Hodge bundle. It is shown that the moduli space \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{0,n}({\\mathbb P}^2,d)\\) is nonsingular and equi-dimensional. Also a recursion for rational plane curves is discussed here. Let \\(N_d\\) denote the number of rational curves to \\({\\mathbb P}^2\\) through \\(3d-1\\) general points in \\({\\mathbb P}^2\\). For \\(d>1\\), there is a formula for \\(N_d\\), and the proof is presented here.\n\nChapter 26 (The virtual fundamental class, Gromov-Witten invariants, and descendant invariants): The virtual fundamental class is discussed, and then Gromov-Witten and descendant invariants are defined. The space of stable maps carries a virtual fundamental class, denoted \\([\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X, \\beta )]^{\\text{vir}}\\), which lies in the expected dimension. The full construction is not presented here but in three special cases, a simple interpretation of the virtual class is presented. In the case the moduli space is unobstructed, the virtual fundamental class is the ordinary fundamental class. When the moduli space is nonsingular, the virtual fundamental class is the Euler class. In the case \\(g=0\\) and \\(X\\) is a hypersurface, there is a canonical homology class which describes the virtual fundamental class, which involves \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{0,n}({\\mathbb P}^m,d)\\). Relations among these three special cases are worked out, as well as Witten's formula. The virtual fundamental class is paired against the cohomology classes to define the Gromov-Witten invariants. Given cohomology classes \\(\\gamma_1, \\cdots,\\gamma_n\\in H^*(X)\\), the Gromov-Witten invariant is defined by \n\\[\n\\langle\\gamma_1,\\cdots, \\gamma_n \\rangle^X_{g,\\beta}:=\\int_{[\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n} (X,\\beta )]^{\\text{vir}}} ev_1^*(\\gamma_1)\\cup \\cdots\\cup ev^*_n (\\gamma_n).\n\\]\n A generalization of the Gromov-Witten invariants, the descendant invariants are defined, which couple Gromov-Witten invariants with topological gravity. The three equations, namely, string, dilation and divisor equations hold for descendant invariants. Also in the case of genus \\(0\\), descendant invariants can be uniquely reconstructed from Gromov-Witten invariants. This chapter also discusses the quantum cohomology ring, and small quantum cohomology ring.\n\nChapter 27 (Localization on the moduli space of maps): The techniques of torus localization on the moduli spaces of stable maps to \\({\\mathbb P}^m\\) is introduced. The torus action on \\({\\mathbb P}^m\\) lifts to an action on the space of maps, and integrals over the moduli space can be reduced via the localization formula to integrals over the space of maps fixed by the torus, which are much simpler. These methods are applied to \\(\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{0,n}({\\mathbb P}^m,d)\\) identifying the fixed loci with decorated graphs, and then compute their normal bundles. As an application, localization is used to prove the Aspinwall-Morrison formula for the contribution of genus \\(0\\) covers of \\({\\mathbb P}^1\\subset X\\) where \\(X\\) is Calabi-Yau. The localization techniques are discussed in higher genus in the context of the virtual class, ``virtual localization''. Then the full multiple cover formula for \\({\\mathbb P}^1\\) is obtained and its proof is presented. The multiple cover contributions are determined in higher genus by \\(C(1,d)=1/(12d)\\) for \\(g=1\\), and \\(C(g,d)={{|B_{2g}|\\cdot d^{2g-3}}\\over {2g\\cdot (2g-2)!}}=|\\chi({\\mathcal M}_g)| {{d^{2g-3}}\\over {(2g-3)!}}\\) for \\(g\\geq 2\\). Here \\(B_{2g}\\) is the \\(2g\\)-th Bernoulli number and \\(\\chi({\\mathcal M}_g)\\) is the orbifold Euler characteristic of \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\).\n\nChapter 28 (The fundamental solution of the quantum differential equation): This chapter studies a solution of a differential equation arising in mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology. The quantum differential equation is defined and its fundamental solution is obtained. These objects take simpler forms if one passes to the small quantum differential equation and its solution.\n\nChapter 29 (The mirror conjecture for hypersurfaces. I: The Fano case): The mirror conjecture for a quintic threefold \\(X\\subset {\\mathbb P}^4\\) is formulated, and the proof is provided along the line of Givental's method. Let \\(X\\) be a hypersurface in \\({\\mathbb P}^m\\) of degree \\(\\ell\\leq m+1\\). The ``correlator'' \\(S_X(t)\\) is obtained from the fundamental solution of the quantum differential equation for \\(X\\), and encapsulate Gromov-Witten and descendant invariants. It is related to a certain hypergeometric series \\(S_X^*(t)\\), which arises as a solution to the Picard-Fuchs differential equation. The precise relationship is divided into three cases : (i) Fano index \\(>1\\) case, (ii) Fano index \\(1\\) case, and (iii) Calabi-Yau case. This chapter discusses the first two cases. The mirror conjecture is a relation between \\(S_X(t)\\) and \\(S_X^*(t)\\). In case (i), \\(S_X(t)=S_X^*(t)\\), and in case (ii), \\(S_X(t)=e^{-m!e^t}S_X^*(t)\\), and proofs are presented here. The Clemens conjecture is stated for a generic quintic threefold.\n\nChapter 30 (The mirror conjecture for hypersurfaces. II: The Calabi-Yau case): This chapter presents a proof of the mirror conjecture (that \\(S_X(t)\\) and \\(S_X^*(t)\\) are related by mirror transformation) in the Calabi-Yau case, which is the most difficult and interesting case. Again the exposition follows Givental's idea. First correlator recursions (e.g., \\(z\\)-recursion) are written down, though they involve functions which are not yet determined. Givental goes around this problem imposing additional conditions on the correlators. This is accommodated by the polynomiality constraint. A geometric construction is carried out to understand the polynomiality constraint on the correlator \\(\\Phi(z,e^t)\\), or the double correlator \\(\\Phi^Y(z,e^t)\\) (where \\(Y\\) is a correlator). A necessary and sufficient condition is found for a correlator to satisfy Givental's polynomiality condition. A special class of correlators, called correlators of class \\(\\mathcal P\\), is introduced. A set of correlators is in class \\(\\mathcal P\\) if it satisfies (i) the rationality and regularity conditions, (ii) a special recursive relation, and (iii) polynomiality condition. For those correlators in class \\(\\mathcal P\\), a uniqueness result is proved, which is essential for a proof of mirror symmetry conjecture. Then an explicit transformation is found between \\(S_X^*(t, h=1)\\) and \\(S_X(t, h=1)\\) that yields the mirror prediction in the quintic threefold case.\n\nThe next nine chapters are devoted to advanced topics, discussing topological strings at higher genus and holomorphic anomaly, applications of mirror symmetry, D-branes, Kontsevich's mirror symmetry conjecture, Fukaya category, the derived categories, and open strings, among other results.\n\nChapter 31 (Topological strings): In the two-dimensional QFT theories, one fixes the worldsheet geometry, i.e., fix a Riemann surface. The idea of a modified theory is to vary Riemann surfaces. This chapter discusses one such generalized theory, known as topological string theory, first introduced by Witten. The modified theory can be viewed as a special type of ``bosonic string'' theory. In this theory, the topological sigma models are coupled with worldsheet gravity. What does it mean to integrate over worldsheet geometries in the context of topological sigma models? A topological string theory for Calabi-Yau threefolds is especially nice and defined here. Let \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\) be the moduli space of Riemann surface of genus \\(g\\). For \\(g>1\\), the genus \\(g\\) topological string amplitude \\(F_g\\) is defined involving the measure on \\({\\mathcal M}_g\\). (For \\(g=1\\), some modification is required.) \\(F_g\\) should be viewed as a section of a bundle over it, rather than a function on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Also \\(F_g\\) is not holomorphic. To measure how it fails to be holomorphic, the anomaly equation is introduced.\n\nChapter 32 (Topological string amplitudes): This chapter gives a reinterpretation of the topological string amplitude from the target space point of view. This requires lots more background in string theory, and this chapter purports to do that. There are two types of superstring theories of closed strings, namely Type IIA and Type IIB theories. Worldsheet conformal invariance imposes that the target space should be ten-dimensional, a physically interesting case is \\({\\mathbb R}^{3,1}\\times X^{(6)}\\): the product of four-dimensional Minkowski space with a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau threefold. If \\(X\\) is a generic Calabi-Yau threefold \\(X\\) with SU(3), holonomy corresponds to \\(N=2\\) supersymmetry in four dimensions. What topological string computes in connection with target space physics questions? Let \\(F_g(t_i)\\) denote the genus \\(g\\) topological amplitude. In the Type IIA-model, \\(F_g\\) will be the partition function on \\(X\\) and the \\(t_i\\) parameterize the KÃ¤hler class of \\(X\\) and in the Type IIB-model, the \\(t_i\\) parameterize complex moduli of \\(X\\). Mirror symmetry relates the \\(A\\)-model to the corresponding \\(M\\)-model in the mirror Calabi-Yau, and the theory of Type IIA superstring on \\(X\\) is equivalent to the theory of Type IIB superstring on the mirror Calabi-Yau. (This is what is commonly referred to ``mirror symmetry'' in the mathematical literature.) To define topological strings on Riemann surfaces with boundaries, with a choice of boundary condition, the concept of D-branes is introduced. The topological string amplitude is determined by the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants \\(n_r^Q\\) (which are all integers).\n\nChapter 33 (Mathematical formulation of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants): The Gopakumar-Vafa invariants completely determine the topological amplitudes. This chapter presents the mathematical framework that computes the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. Recall that Gopakumar-Vafa invariants \\(n_r^Q\\) capture the SU\\((2)_L\\) content of the number of wrapped BPS D2-branes with charge \\(Q\\in H_2(X,\\mathbb Z)\\). For a generic Calabi-Yau threefold \\(X\\), there is a formula \\(F_g=\\sum_{\\beta\\in H_2(X,{\\mathbb Z})} N_{\\beta}^g q^{\\beta}\\), where \\(N_{\\beta}^g\\in{\\mathbb Q}\\) are the Gromov-Witten invariants and are given by the degree of the virtual fundamental class \\(\\deg[\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,0}(X, \\beta)]^{\\text{virt}}\\). The data of the \\(N_{\\beta}^g\\) is encoded in the BPS invariants \\(n_{\\beta}^r\\) (or \\(n_{\\beta}^Q\\)). The goal of this chapter is to understand these invariants. A number of examples on how to calculate \\(N_{\\beta}^r\\) are discussed, and mathematical arguments are presented for the definition of \\(n^g\\), which involves Hilbert schemes.\n\nChapter 34 (Multiple covers, integrality, and Gopakumar-Vafa invariants): This chapter discusses the integrality conjectures of Gopakumar-Vafa and a generalized integrality conjecture for Gromov-Witten invariants for Calabi-Yau threefolds. The conjecture is that the Gromov-Witten invariants \\(n_{\\beta}^0\\) are integers for all Calabi-Yau threefolds \\(X\\) and curve class \\(\\beta\\neq 0\\). A geometric interpretation of \\(n_{\\beta}^0\\) is proposed by Gopakumar and Vafa in a more general setting. First Gopakumar and Vafa define the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants \\(n_{\\beta}^g\\) for each genus \\(g\\) and each nonzero curve class \\(\\beta\\in H_2(X,{\\mathbb Z})\\) by an explicit formula, and then they conjecture that \\(n_{\\beta}^g\\) are integers for all Calabi-Yau threefolds \\(X\\), genus \\(g\\geq 0\\), and curve classes \\(\\beta\\neq 0\\). The Gopakumar-Vafa invariants \\(n_{\\beta}^g\\) arise as BPS state counts in Type IIA string theory. The background of the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture is presented here together with the further generalization to vector-valued invariants by Pandharripande.\n\nChapter 35 (Mirror symmetry at higher genus): This chapter discusses how to use mirror symmetry to count holomorphic maps from higher genus curves to Calabi-Yau threefolds. The genus \\(1\\) closed string amplitude on the two-dimensional target space \\(T^2\\) is calculated. This is compared with the Ray-Singer torsion. The \\(B\\)-model calculation of closed string higher-genus amplitudes on Calabi-Yau threefolds uses the holomorphic anomaly equations. The mirror map is introduced to identify the \\(A\\)-model and \\(B\\)-model topological string amplitudes. Holomorphic anomaly equations are further studied here, and these are solved for a number of examples. The topological open string annulus amplitude on \\(T^2\\) is also discussed.\n\nChapter 36 (Some applications of mirror symmetry): This chapter discusses a couple of applications of mirror symmetry and topological string amplitudes. The first application is the so-called geometric engineering of gauge theories. Singularities of the target space of string theory have an interpretation as giving rise to gauge theories in target space, and mirror symmetry allows one to compute certain quantities in the gauge theory. The idea of identifying string propagation in geometric singularities with certain gauge theories is known as geometric engineering of gauge theories. The exposition on this application is focused on specific examples. Starting with ADE singularities of \\(K3\\) surfaces and ADE gauge groups, Seiberg-Witten theory is illustrated for \\(N=2\\) supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory in four dimensions. The gauge coupling \\(\\tau(a)\\) is the sum of a perturbative part and a non-perturbative part, and moreover, \\(\\tau\\) is related to the genus \\(0\\) prepotential of the topological string and hence can be computed using mirror symmetry. Another application involves studying the large \\(N\\) limit of gauge theories. This is a Chern-Simon theory on topological strings in the presence of D-branes. The SU\\((N)\\) Chern-Simon theory on \\(S^3\\) is equivalent to the closed topological string \\(A\\)-model on the total space of \\({\\mathcal O}(-1)\\oplus{\\mathcal O}(-1)\\) over \\({\\mathbb{CP}}^1\\).\n\nChapter 37 (Aspects of mirror symmetry and D-branes): This chapter discusses how mirror symmetry acts on D-branes. D-branes are incorporated into mirror symmetry, and the D-brane correspondence under mirror symmetry leads to the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture about the structure of Calabi-Yau manifolds with mirror symmetry (special Lagrangian fibrations) and how to find the mirror manifold geometrically. The mirror symmetry action on a D-brane is described in detail for the elliptic curve case. A mathematical characterization of D-branes is presented, e.g., D-branes are viewed mathematically by Kontsevich as objects in a category and the D-brane correspondence (mirror symmetry) is interpreted as an equivalence of two categories. Let \\((M, \\widetilde M)\\) be a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The categories involved in Kontsevich's mirror scenario are the derived category \\({\\mathcal D}^b(M)\\) and the Fukaya \\(A^{\\infty}\\) category \\({\\mathcal F}^0(\\widetilde M)\\). Kontsevich's conjecture states that \\((M, \\widetilde M)\\) form a mirror pair if and only if \\({\\mathcal D}^b(M)\\simeq {\\mathcal F}^0(\\widetilde M)\\). The categorical equivalence is proved in detail in the case of elliptic curves or a torus.\n\nChapter 38 (More on the mathematics of D-branes: bundles, derived categories, and Lagrangians): In this chapter, the derived category is explained. Kontsevich's prediction is that the derived category is a very strong invariant of a complex variety (in fact, stronger than D-branes, cohomology theory or \\(K\\)-theory), and the whole \\(B\\)-model string theory should be recovered from it. On the \\(A\\)-model side, D-branes are given by special Lagrangians and this is explained in detail here.\n\nChapter 39 (Boundary \\(N=2\\) theories): This chapter studies quantum field theory on \\(1+1\\)-dimensional manifolds with boundary. Such a system appears as the theory on the worldsheet of an open string. Topics studied here are free field theories with linear boundary conditions, boundary states and their properties, and the axial anomaly induced from boundary conditions, among others. The spectrum of supersymmetric states of various open string systems is determined.\n\nChapter 40 (References): This chapter lists references. In particular, for part V, ``Advanced topics'', the list of references is extensive.\n\nIn conclusion, the book covers tremendous amounts of pedagogical materials in mathematics and physics as well as the recent developments on mirror symmetry. It can be regarded as the most updated and most comprehensive book on the subject. It is highly recommended for graduate students, and young as well as established researchers in mathematics and physics who wish to learn about mirror symmetry.",1

The proof does not need geometric invariant theory and is based on interpreting the moduli problem as a subfunctor of a Quot-functor over a relative Grassmannian.

We recall that a Mori domain was introduced by \textit{J. Querré} in [Cours d'algèbre. Masson (1976; Zbl 0341.00001)] and has been studied extensively since then. A Mori domain is an integral domain which satisfies the ascending chain condition on integral divisorial ideals. This notion has been extended to commutative rings with zero-divisors, especially by Lucas where various equivalent conditions have been studied. This paper represents the investigation of the natural extension of the Mori property to orders in simple Artinian rings. These are called right Mori orders. An order \(S\) in a simple Artinian ring \(Q\) is called a right Mori order if the ascending chain condition holds on the set of integral right \(\nu\)-ideals.

While the localization of a Mori domain is a Mori domain, we see that this does not hold for Mori rings. This leads to the author asking similar questions about which properties of Mori domains carry over to Mori orders. There are several nice results which we now summarize. The intersection of a family of right Mori orders of finite character are a right Mori order. The non-commutative Krull orders of Marubayashi are right and left Mori orders. If two local orders have the same set of prime ideals, then one is a right Mori order if and only if the other is. The author provides an example which demonstrates that a right Mori order need not be a left Mori order.",0

Then for any sequence \\((x_n)\\) of points in \\(X(\\overline K)\\) such that (a) \\(h_{\\overline L}(x_n)\\) converges to \\(0\\) and (b) any subsequence of \\((x_n)\\) is dense in \\(X\\) with respect to the Zariski topology, the sequence of probability measures \\((\\mu_n)\\) on \\(X_\\sigma(\\mathbb{C})\\) given by \n\\[\n\\mu_n = {1\\over \\#O(x_n)} \\sum_{x\\in O(x_n)} \\delta_{\\sigma(x)}\n\\]\n (\\(O(x_n)\\) being the orbit of \\(x_n\\) under the Galois group of \\(\\overline K/K\\)) converges vaguely to the measure \\(\\mu= c_1(\\overline L)^{d-1} / c_1(L)^{d-1}\\).\n\n\nNote that the result of \\textit{S. Zhang} on arithmetic ampleness [J. Am. Math. Soc. 8, No. 1, 187-221 (1995; Zbl 0861.14018)] implies under hypotheses (a) and (b) that the height \\(h_{\\overline L}(X)\\leq 0\\). Granted the equality, the proof of the theorem goes by twisting the Hermitian metric by any small enough smooth function.\n\n\nThe authors also show (Proposition 4.1) how the theory of adelic metrics, as developed by \\textit{S. Zhang} [J. Algebr. Geom. 4, No. 2, 281-300 (1995; Zbl 0861.14019)], allows one to extend the result stated to quite more general situations in the most interesting example of abelian varieties and Neron-Tate heights. The limit measure is in this case the normalized Haar measure on the complex tori underlying the abelian variety.\n\n\nUnder Bogomolov's conjecture and in the case of abelian varieties, Hypothesis (b) of Theorem 4.1 may be replaced by supposing that no subsequence of \\((x_n)\\) is contained in a strict algebraic subgroup of \\(X\\).

VANETs are used mostly for road safety and traffic efficiency; therefore, it is imperative that the communication between vehicles is rapid and secure in a VANET environment. In the present study, bilinear pairings were used to construct a complete message authentication scheme. This scheme provided the following features: (1) vehicle or roadside unit (RSU) parameters were determined via a hierarchical protocol, which prevented potentially a large computational overhead for a single node; (2) message broadcasts and private communications between vehicles in the transmission range of the same RSU were enabled; (3) message broadcasts and private communications between vehicles in the transmission ranges of different RSUs were enabled; (4) a fast handoff mechanism was established for vehicles in the transmission ranges of different RSUs; and (5) mechanisms for message broadcasts and private communication were established for vehicles in areas where RSUs were sparsely located. Based on the experimental results, our scheme was confirmed to be superior to previous schemes.

Math. 122, No. 2, 231-276 (1995; Zbl 0849.16022)], the authors have classified Noetherian graded domains of quadratic growth over algebraically closed fields; the paper under review extends this classification to semiprime algebras over an arbitrary base field \\(k\\). In some sense, the description of noncommutative projective curves that was begun in the earlier paper can thus be considered complete.\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a semiprime, Noetherian, connected graded \\(k\\)-algebra of quadratic growth. The description of \\(R\\) in terms of geometric data proceeds, roughly speaking, along the following lines: Let \\(Y\\) be a projective variety of dimension \\(\\leq 1\\) over the base field \\(k\\) and let \\(\\mathcal E\\) be an \\({\\mathcal O}_Y\\)-order in a finite dimensional semisimple algebra \\(A\\) over the field \\(K=k(Y)\\). Also, let \\(\\tau\\) be an automorphism of \\(A\\) that restricts to an automorphism \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(Y\\), and let \\(\\mathcal B\\) be an ample, invertible \\(\\mathcal E\\)-module. Following \\textit{M.~Van den Bergh} [J. Algebra 184, No. 2, 435-490 (1996; Zbl 0876.17011)], a Noetherian ``twisted homogeneous coordinate ring'' can be constructed as \\(B=\\bigoplus_n H^0(Y,{\\mathcal B}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes{\\mathcal B}^{\\tau^{n-1}})\\). The ring \\(R\\) is then Noetherian if and only if some Veronese subring \\(R^{(m)}\\) of \\(R\\) has the form \\(k+I\\), where \\(I\\) is a left ideal of such a ring \\(B\\) and where \\(I=B\\) at each point \\(p\\in Y\\) at which \\(\\sigma\\) has finite order. A lot of detailed information concerning semiprime graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2 is obtained from this characterization. For example, a finitely generated, semiprime graded Goldie ring \\(S\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S)=2\\) is non-Noetherian if and only if there exists a second layer link from a prime ideal \\(P\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S/P)=1\\) to a maximal ideal \\(M\\) of \\(S\\).","zbMATH_ID

Here we show that the Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice \\(n\\)-simplex has a simple analytical interpretation from the perspective of Fourier Analysis on the \\(n\\)-torus.

S. Haldane}, Amer. Nat. 71, 337-349 (1937), argued that, in equilibrium populations, the effect of deleterious mutation on average fitness depends primarily on the mutation rate and is independent of the severity of the mutations. Specifically, the equilibrium population fitness is \(e^{-\mu_ H}\), where \(\mu_ H\) is the haploid genomic mutation rate.


Here we extend Haldane's result to a variety of reproductive systems. Using an analysis based on the frequency of classes of individuals with a specified number of mutations, we show that Haldane's principle holds exactly for haploid sex, haploid apomixis, and facultative haploid sex. In the cases of diploid automixis with terminal fusion, diploid automixis with central fusion, and diploid selfing, Haldane' principle holds exactly for recessive mutations and approximately for mutations with some heterozygous effect.


In the cases of K-ploid apomixis, diploid endomitosis, and haplodiploidy, we show that Haldane's principle holds exactly for recessive lethal mutations. In addition we extend Haldane's result to various mixtures of the above-mentioned reproductive systems.",0
1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group.

The main contribution of this paper is the adaptation of notions fundamental to the representative sets technique to the design of approximation algorithms: The author introduces the definition of ``approximate lopsided universal sets'', combining partial executions of representative sets-based algorithms with approximation algorithms, and adapting the iterative expansion framework (in the context of representative sets) to the design of parameterized approximation algorithms.

It appears somewhat unexpected that this bound is almost exponentially, but it comes out very natural from just two ingredients.

Let \({\mathbb R}^{n,1}\) be the Minkowski space \(\displaystyle{{\mathbb R}^{n,1} = \bigl({\mathbb R}^{n+1}, \sum_{i=1}^n dx_i^2 - dx_{n+1}^2 \bigr)}\) with the canonical coordinates \((x_1, \dots, x_{n+1})\). Let \(\Omega\) be a smooth bounded domain in \({\mathbb R}^{n}= \{x_{n+1} = 0\}\) and let \(u\) be a smooth function defined on \(\overline{\Omega}\) satisfying \(\displaystyle{\sup_{\overline{\Omega}} | Du| < 1}\). Such a function \(u\) is called a spacelike function. Let \(M\) be the graph of the function \(u\), i.e., \(M=\{(x, u(x)): x \in \overline{\Omega}\}\) which is a spacelike hypersurface of \({\mathbb R}^{n,1}\). Setting \(\hat e_i= e_i + u_i e_{n+1}\), where \(e_i\) denotes the canonical basis of \({\mathbb R}^{n+1}\) and \(u_i\) denotes the partial derivative, the matrix, \(A(Du)\), of the induced scalar product with respect to the basis \(\{\hat e_i\}\) is given by \(A(Du)_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - u_iu_j\) and the inverse \(\displaystyle{A^{-1}(Du)_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \frac{u_iu_j}{\omega^2}}\), where \(\omega = \sqrt{1-| Du| ^2}\). Then the matrix of the curvature endomorphism of \(M\) in the basis \(\{\hat e_i\}\) is \(\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\omega} A^{-1}(Du) D^2u}\) and the \(m\)-th order curvature of \(M\) at each point \(p\in M\) is defined by
\[
 {\mathcal H}_m (p) = \frac{1}{_nC_m} \sigma_m(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n),
\]
 where \(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n\) are the principal curvatures of \(M\) at the point \(p\) and \(\sigma_m\) the \(m\)-th elementary symmetric function. Thus the first order curvature is just the mean curvature and the second order curvature is the scalar curvature of \(M\). One can thus define the \(m\)-th order curvature operator acting on the spacelike function over \(\Omega\) by
\[
 {\mathcal H}_m[u] = \frac{1}{_nC_m \omega^m} \sum_{I, J} A^{IJ}(Du) (D^2u)_{IJ},
\]
 where the summation is over the \(m\)-tuples and \(A^{IJ}(Du)\) and \((D^2u)_{IJ}\) are the minors of indices \(I, J\) of \(A^{-1}(Du)\) and \(D^2u\), respectively. We call a smooth function \(u\) defined on \(\overline{\Omega}\) \textit{admissible} if it satisfies
\[
 \sup_{\overline{\Omega}} | Du| < 1\quad \text{and} \quad {\mathcal H}_k[u] > 0\quad(1\leq k\leq m).
\]
 The author proves if \(\Omega\) is a smooth bounded domain in \({\mathbb R}^3\) and strictly convex, and \(H\) a smooth positive function on \(\overline{\Omega}\), then given a spacelike function \(\varphi\) which is strictly convex, the following Dirichlet problem
\[
 \left\{ \begin{aligned} {\mathcal H}_2[u] &= H \quad \text{in}\quad \Omega\\ u&=\varphi\quad \text{on}\quad \partial \Omega \end{aligned} \right.
\]
 has a unique solution. In case \({\mathbb R}^4\), the author also shows that if \(H\) is constant, then the Dirichlet problem is also uniquely solvable. The proof relies on a standard continuity method which reduces it to a priori \(C^1\)- and \(C^2\)-estimates. These estimates imply \({\mathcal H}_m\) is uniformly elliptic. The author shows two types of \(C^2\)-estimates, i.e., normal second derivatives estimates and mixed (tangential-normal) second derivatives estimates on the boundary. And the maximum principle is also needed to complete the proof of the main result. The dimension restriction, \(n=3\) or \(n=4\) and \(m=2\), follows from the maximum principle and normal second derivatives estimates, whereas the \(C^1\) global estimate and the tangential-normal second derivatives estimate on the boundary can be obtained without any dimension restriction.

 The author also conjectures that such a Dirichlet problem might be always solvable in any dimension \(n\) and any \(m\) if \(\Omega\) is a smooth convex bounded domain which has at least \(m-1\) positive principal curvatures at every boundary point.",0

Für die allgemeine eingliedrige Untergruppe von \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) ergibt sich die Darstellung
\[
 x=x_0+a_1s, \quad y=y_0+(a_2+a_3x_0)s+\dfrac{a_1a_3}{2}s^2, \quad z=z_0+a_3s\quad \biggl(z=\dfrac{dy}{dx}\biggr),
\]
 aus welcher Verf. fünf wesensverschiedene Typen ableitet:

(I) \(a_1 \neq 0, a_3 \neq 0\) (Drehungen), (II) \(a_1 = 0, a_3 \neq 0\) (isotrope Drehungen),

(III) \(a_1\neq 0, a_3=0\) (Schiebungen), (IV) \(a_1=a_3=0\) (isotrope Schiebungen), (V) \(a_1= a_2 = a_3 = 0\) (Identität).

Die bei diesen Transformationen entstehenden Linienelementkonfigurationen heißen bzw. parabolische Elementenkreise (I), lineare Elementenreihen erster Art (II), lineare Elementenreihen zweiter Art (III), isotrope lineare Elementenreihen (IV).

Die Gruppe der einmal erweiterten Grenzbewegungen der isotropen Ebene ist einfach transitiv. Ist \((0,0,0)\) ein ``Grundelement'', \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) ein weiteres Linienelement, so entsteht \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) aus \((0, 0,0)\) vermöge einer und nur einer Transformation mit den Parameterwerten \(a_1 = x_0, a_2 =y_0, a_3 = z_0\). Jedes Linienelement erscheint so als Repräsentant einer und nur einer Grenzbewegung. Um diese grundlegende Auffassung weiter auszubauen, empfiehlt sich zunächst eine geeignete homogene Darstellung der Bewegungen der Grenzgruppe \(\mathfrak G_3^r\):
\[
 1: x: y: z = x_0: x_1: x_2: x_3 \quad (x_0 \neq 0);\quad 1: a_1: a_2: a_3 = \alpha_0: \alpha_1: \alpha _2 :\alpha_3 \quad (\alpha_0\neq 0).
\]
 Schreibt man
\[
 \alpha =\alpha_0e_0+\alpha _1e_1+\alpha_2e_2+\alpha_3e_3.
\]
 so entspricht jeder hyperkomplexen Zahl \(a\) ein Parametersystem erster Art
\[
 \alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 \;(\alpha _0\neq 0)
\]
 derart, daß für die Zusammensetzung zweier Bewegungen der Grenzgruppe von den Parametern \(\alpha \) und \(\alpha'\)
\[
 \alpha'' =\alpha\alpha'
\]
 gilt, wofern nur dem hyperkomplexen System die Produkttafel

\noindent zu Grunde gelegt wird.

Verlangt man \(\varrho \alpha \equiv \alpha \varrho\{\alpha\}\), so ergeben sich als ``totalkommutative'' Größen einzig die Zahlen \(\varrho = \varrho_0x_0+ \varrho_2x_2\). Dies bedeutet geometrisch: Die isotropen Schiebungen und nur diese sind mit allen Bewegungen der Grenzgruppe vertauschbar.

Die nichtisotropen Linienelemente repräsentieren sich offenbar als einfachste Beispiele \textit{Study}scher Somen, und man ist versucht, die Geometrie der Linienelemente als \textit{Study}sche Kinematik in der isotropen Ebene auszubauen. Zwei Somen heißen äquivalent, wenn sie durch eine Bewegung der Grenzgruppe \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) ineinander übergeführt werden können. Außer den ``Rechtsbewegungen'' \(x' = x\alpha\) (in hyperkomplexer Schreibweise) erfordert der Äquivalenzbegriff auch die Verwendung sogenannter ``Linksbewegungen'' \(y' = y\) (die hyperkomplexen Zahlen des Systems sind nichtkommutativ), deren Inbegriff eine dreigliedrige einfach transitive Gruppe \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) bildet, die mit \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) vertauschbar ist. Eine genauere Einsicht in das Wesen von \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) erhält man wiederum aus der Konstruktion der eingliedrigen Untergruppen. Allgemein ergibt sich:
\[
 x= x_0 + b_1s,\quad y = y_0 + (b_2 + b_1z_0)s + \dfrac{b_1b_3}{2}s^2, \quad z = z_0 + b_3s,
\]
 woraus man vier wesensverschiedene Typen ableitet:

(I) \(b_1\neq 0, b_3 \neq 0\): allgemeine Linksdrehung, (II) \(b_1= 0, b_3 \neq 0\): isotrope Linksdrehung, (III) \(b_1\neq0, b_3=0\): allgemeine Linksschiebung, (IV) \(b_1=b_3 = 0\): isotrope Linksschiebung (Dilatation).

Für \(b_1=b_2 = b_3 = 0\) entsteht wiederum die Identität.

Im Gegensatz zu den Rechtsbewegungen unterliegen bei den Linksbewegungen alle Elemente gleichzeitig (d.h. für dieselbe Änderung des ``Zeitparameters'' \(s\)) völlig gleichartigen Bewegungsvorschriften. Verf. betrachtet daher die isotrope Ebene als Exerzierplatz, die Linienelemente als Soldaten daselbst, \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) als Exerzierreglement und formuliert den Satz: Die (für Somen einfach transitive) Gruppe der gewöhnlichen Bewegungen in der isotropen Ebene hat zur reziproken Gruppe jene der militärischen Exerzierbewegungen.

Die Gruppe der isotropen Schiebungen innerhalb \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) und diejenige der Dilatationen in \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) fallen zusammen. Daher ist die ``Übergruppe'' \(G^r_3\cdot \mathfrak G_3^l= \mathfrak G_5\) eine bloß fünfgliedrige Gruppe. Dazu formuliert Verf. folgenden natürlichen Äquivalenzbegriff: Zwei Somenscharen sind dann und nur dann äquivalent, wenn es mindestens eine Transformation aus \(\mathfrak G_5\) gibt, welche die eine Schar in die andere überführt.

Nach diesen umfassenden Vorbereitungen kommt Verf. nunmehr zum eigentlichen Thema. Im vierten Kapitel erfolgt die Deutung von \(\alpha _0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_4\) als homogene cartesische Punktkoordinaten eines euklidischen Raumes. Jeder regulären Bewegung (\(\alpha_0 \neq 0\)) entspricht so ein und nur ein Punkt dieses euklidischen Raumes. Der eigentliche Sinn der \textit{Lie}schen Abbildung ist mithin folgender: Jedes eigentliche nichtisotrope Linienelement der isotropen Ebene bestimmt durch seine relative Lage zum Grundelement eindeutig eine Grenzbewegung in der isotropen Ebene, und diese überträgt sich eindeutig auf einen Punkt des euklidischen Bildraums.

Die \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung ist mit der \textit{Lie}schen quadratisch verwandt. Die genauere Untersuchung (Kap. V) ergibt für den Zusammenhang der Parameter der beiden Abbildungen:
\[
 \begin{matrix} \sigma_0=\alpha _0^2 & \sigma_2=\alpha_0 \alpha_2-\tfrac 12\alpha_1\alpha_3; & \alpha _0=\sigma_0^2, & \alpha _2=\sigma_0\sigma_2+\sigma_1\sigma_3,\\ \sigma_1=\alpha _0\alpha_1, & \alpha_3 =\tfrac12\alpha _0\alpha _3; & \alpha _1=\sigma _0\sigma_1, & \alpha _3=2\sigma _0\sigma_3. \end{matrix}
\]


Ferner gilt \(\sigma''= \sigma\sigma'\), wofern für die hyperkomplexen Zahlen
\[
 \sigma=\sigma_0e_0+\sigma_1e_1+\sigma_2e_2+\sigma_3e_3
\]
 die Multiplikationstabelle

\hfil\vbox{\offinterlineskip\halign{ \strut\(#\)&#&#&\vrule#&&\ \(#\)\ \cr && && e_0 && e_1 && e_2 && e_3 \cr \multispan{11}\hrulefill&&\cr &&\(e_0\) && e_0 && e_1 && e_2 && e_3 \cr &&\(e_1\) && e_1 && 0 && 0 && e_2 \cr &&\(e_2\) && e_2 && 0 && 0 && 0 \cr &&\(e_3\) && e_3 && -e_2 && 0 && 0 \cr }}\hfil

\noindent verwendet wird. Dann ergeben sich für \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) bzw. \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) die Darstellungen
\[
 \xi' =\xi_\sigma \;\text{bzw.} \;\eta'=\tau \eta \;(\tau'' =\tau'\tau).
\]
 Auch für diese zweite Darstellung der Gruppen \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) und \(\mathfrak G_3^l\) ergeben sich die analogen Fallunterscheidungen: (I) allgemeine Rechts- bzw. Linksdrehung, (II) isotrope Rechtsbzw. Linksdrehung, (III) nichtisotrope Schiebung bzw. isotrope Linksschiebung, (IV) isotrope Schiebung bzw. Dilatation, (V) Identität.

Deutet man auch die homogenen Parameter \(\sigma_0, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3\) als homogene Punktkoordinaten eines euklidischen Raumes, so ist dadurch eine zweite eineindeutige Abbildung der regulären Somen (\(\sigma_0\neq0\)) bzw. Bewegungen auf die Punkte eines dreidimensionalen euklidischen Raumes gewonnen. Insbesondere überträgt die \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung Vereine von Linienelementen (bzw. Somen) auf Gewindekurven, d. h. Kurven, deren Tangenten dem Gewinde \(p_{02}- p_{31} = 0\) angehören.

Gehören \(T_\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) variabel) und \(T_\gamma \) (\(\gamma\) fest) zur Gruppe \(\mathfrak G\), so gilt für \(T_{\lambda'} = T_\lambda T_\gamma\) \(\lambda_i'=f_i(\lambda,\gamma)\). Die Transformationen \(\lambda_i\to \lambda_i'\) bilden die erste Parametergruppe von \(\mathfrak G\). Die zweite, \(\lambda_i'\to \lambda_i\), entstellt durch entsprechende Vertauschung der Rollen von Variablen und Parametern. Jede einfach transitive Gruppe läßt sich durch geeignete Parameterwahl mit ihrer ersten, ihre reziproke Gruppe ebenso mit der zweiten Parametergruppe identifizieren. Auf diese Weise erhält man eine neue Deutung für die reziproken einfach transitiven Gruppen \(\mathfrak G_3^r\) und \(\mathfrak G_3^l\): Sie erscheinen als Parametergruppen der Grenzbewegungsgruppe der isotropen Ebene. Man hat also bei neuer Terminologie und neuer Symbolik vier Gruppen zu unterscheiden (Kap. VI):
\[
 \begin{matrix} x' = x\alpha \;\text{Rechtsdrehungen} \;\;D_3^r & \\ & \text{im Raum} \;R_3^I,\\ y' =\beta y \;\;\text{Linksdrehungen} \;\;D_3^l &\\ \xi' =\xi \sigma \;\text{Rechtsschiebungen} \;\;S_3^r &\\ & \text{im Raum } \;\;R_3^{II}.\\ \eta '=\tau \eta \;\text{Linksschiebungen} \;\;S_3^l &\\ \end{matrix}
\]


Weiterhin zeigt sich: Die bisher verwendeten beiden Darstellungen der Gruppe der Grenzbewegungen in der isotropen Ebene sind bis auf lineare Transformationen die einzigen, die auf projektive Parametergruppen führen.

Die weitere Entwicklung der Kinematik der isotropen Ebene (Kap. VII) stützt sich vor allem auf den Umstand, daß die aus \(D_3^r\) und \(D_3^l\) bzw. \(S_3^r\) und \(S_3^l\) gebildeten fünfgliedrigen Übergruppen zusammenfallen und eine und dieselbe Gruppe \(G_5\) bestimmen. Die Transformationen \(G_5\) sind unimodular, lassen zwei Geraden fest und das singuläre Bogenelement \(ds^2 = dx_1dx_3\) invariant. Ein Raum von diesen Eigenschaften kann durch Tangentialräume (isotrope Räume) der absoluten Maßfläche eines (pseudo-) euklidischen vierdimensionalen Raumes \(R_4\) dargestellt werden. Auf diese Weise erscheint die \(G_5\) als \textit{ausgezeichnete} Bewegungsgruppe eines isotropen \(R_3\) und die ganze Untersuchung als ein Ausschnitt aus der Geometrie eines pseudoeuklidischen \(R_4\). Da die \(G_5\) der Grenzbewegungen des isotropen Raumes aus der \(\mathfrak G_5\) von Links- und Rechtsbewegungen der Minimalebene durch die \textit{Lie}sche oder \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung ihrer Linienelemente hergeleitet erscheint, kann der natürliche Äquivalenzbegriff für die Kinematik dieser Ebene in folgender Weise formuliert werden: Im Sinne der Kinematik der Grenzgruppe der isotropen Ebene äquivalente (``natürlich äquivalente'') Systeme von Linienelementen (Somen, Bewegungen) der isotropen Ebene sind solche, die durch \textit{Lie}sche oder \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung im isotropen Raum Punktfiguren ergeben, die hinsichtlich der Grenzgruppe \(G_5\) dieses isotropen Raumes bewegungskongrnent sind.

Für ein genaueres Studium der Geometrie des isotropen Raumes erweist sich die Existenz der beiden Schiebungsgruppen innerhalb \(G_5\) von großer Bedeutung. Verf. begründet mit ihrer Hilfe eine weitgehende Analogie der Geometrie des isotropen \(R_3\) zur elliptischen sowie quasielliptischen Raumgeometrie (Kap. VIII). Dabei ergibt sich für die systematische Stellung der \textit{Lie-Study}schen Abbildung folgende Reihenfolge charakteristischer Abbildungen: (1) Punkte des elliptischen Raumes \(\to\) Bewegungen bzw. Somen auf der Kugel, (2) Punkte des quasielliptischen Raumes \(\to\) Bewegungen bzw. Somen auf der euklidischen Ebene, (3) Punkte des isotropen Raumes \(\to\) Bewegungen bzw. Somen auf der isotropen Ebene (vgl. dazu \textit{W. Blaschke}, Z. f. Math. u. Phys. 60 (1911), 61-91; \textit{J. Grünwald}, Sitzungsber. Akad. Wien 120 (1911), 677-741 (F. d. M. 42, 499, 702); ferner eine unzugängliche Diss. von \textit{A. E. Mayer} (Wien, 1930)).

In allen vorhergehenden Betrachtungen sind stets isotrope und uneigentliche Linienelemente von der Untersuchung ausgeschlossen worden. Ihnen korrespondieren die singulären Stellen der \textit{Lie}schen bzw. \textit{Lie-Study}schen Abbildung. Diese Lücken zu schließen und die entsprechenden singulären Stellen der Abbildungen zu heben, ist das Ziel der beiden weiteren Kapitel (IX und X). Es kommt darauf an, die bisher noch offene Somenmannigfaltigkeit der isotropen Ebene zu natürlichen Kontinuen abzuschließen. Das wird in Kap. IX erreicht durch den Einbau der Bewegungsgruppe \(G_5\) in die konforme Gruppe des isotropen \(R_3\), in Kap. X durch Einbau in die projektive Gruppe desselben Raumes. Dabei zeigt sich, daß die beiden Abschließungs möglichkeiten genauen Anschluß einmal an die \textit{Lie}sche, das andere Mal an die \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung wahren. Die konforme Gruppe des isotropen Raumes erscheint als Ausschnitt der konformen Gruppe des \(R_4\); der isotrope \(R_3\) erhält von diesem Standpunkt aus den Zusammenhang einer einfach singulären dreifach ausgedehnten Hyperfläche zweiter Ordnung \(\mathfrak M_3^2\) des \(R_4\). Faßt man andererseits die Grenzbewegungen der isotropen Ebene als Ausschnitt solcher Bewegungen des pseudoeuklidischen Raumes auf, welche die isotrope Ebene festlassen, so erweisen sich die \textit{Study}schen Parameter dieser Bewegung im wesentlichen als identisch mit den Parametern \(\sigma_i\) der Grenzbewegung. Deutet man dann \(\sigma_0: \sigma_1: \sigma_2: \sigma_3\) als quaternäres Gebiet eines projektiven Raumes, so ist dieser Bildraum als linearer erzeugender Teilraum der sechsdimensionalen Hyperfläche \(\varPhi _6^2\) im \(R_7\) der \textit{Study}schen analytischen Kinematik aufzufassen, auf welche sich die räumlichen Somen lückenlos umkehrbar eindeutig abbilden lassen. In beiden Fällen gelingt Verf. eine erschöpfende Behandlung aller singulären Fälle unter Benutzung des reichhaltigen Tatsachenmaterials der höheren Geometrie und analytischen Kinematik, wovon hier nur andeutungsweise gesprochen werden kann. Dasselbe gilt vom letzten Kapitel dieser Untersuchung, worin Verf. insbesondere eine der berühmten \textit{Study}schen Biquaternionenformel äquivalente duale Matrizenformel für die Bewegungen des pseudoeuklidischen Raumes erhält, welche die \(\mathfrak G_6\) der pseudoeuklidischen Bewegungen darstellt. Letzhin erscheint dabei die \textit{Lie-Study}sche Abbildung im neuartigen Licht eines gewissen Ausschnittes der \textit{Study}schen analytischen Kinematik.",0
1591107,"From the introduction: Let \\(p,q:\\mathbb{C}^2\\to\\mathbb{C}\\) be two polynomials.

For group actions on general CAT(0) square complexes, we show that an analogous characterisation holds for the so-called WPD condition.

He succeeded!\n\n\nThe Tenth Problem (some might say ``Tenth \\(\\underline{\\text{Class}}\\) of Problems'' since some of Hilbert's problems contain several very hard and largely unconnected problems worthy of separate consideration) is the only obvious decision problem among the 23 classes of problems; of course, any mathematical problem can be reformulated (somewhat artificially) as a decision problem. It asks for a single algorithm to test an arbitrary polynomial with integer coefficients for solvability in integers. The main theme of this book is to show that \\(\\underline{\\text{no}}\\) such algorithm exists. The result was first proved in 1970 by the book's author. The implications of a negative solution to Hilbert's Tenth problem are major not only in theory but in applications, too. E.g., one will not find a polynomial-time solution to an arbitrary scheduling problem. (The Master Scheduling Problem for a realistic Ballistic Missile Defense is surely NP-Complete.)\n\n\nAs an aside to the Tenth Problem, we note that Hilbert's 23 Classes of Problems do not include either Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) or the Four- Color Problem (now a computerized theorem). Hilbert may have concurred with Gauss' feelings concerning the lesser role of FLT itself in mathematics. Indeed, as passions cool, perhaps a precise upper bound for the Selmer group for the semi-stable case may be found so as to finally settle FLT. More likely, yet another approach will be needed -- hopefully using elementary methods \\(\\underline{\\text{alone}}\\) (rather than by exotic algebraico-geometric methods or topological methods). It should be noted that there exists in a constructive sense an individual subproblem of Hilbert's Tenth Problem which is logically equivalent to FLT.\n\n\nThe monograph is very well written and includes a broad spectrum of topics: exponentiation is diophantine; diophantine coding; primality is diophantine; universal diophantine equations; recursive unsolvability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem; bounded universal quantifiers; diophantine complexity and four number-theoretic Appendices. Each chapter has exercises for the reader and commentary on historical perspective. Hints at solutions are provided for many exercises. For example, a rewarding exercise is to reformulate the classical Four-Color Problem as an assertion of the recursive unsolvability of a specific diophantine equation.\n\n\nThe reviewer highly recommends the monograph to students and teachers of computer science, logic and mathematics.\n\n\nFor the English translation see the announcement above (Zbl 0790.03008).",1

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS.

The main result of this paper states that, among the varieties considered, the only ones admitting a rank 1 Ulrich bundle are given by blowing up \(\mathbb{P}^3\) along a curve of genus 3 and degree 6 (see Section 2). Focusing on these varieties, polarized by \(H\), the author shows that \(X\) admits two classes of rank 1 Ulrich bundles (see Section 3). Finally, he proves the existence of stable rank 2 Ulrich bundles with \(c_1 = 3H\) (see Section 4).",0

Name: text, dtype: object","Summary: In many conventional supply chains, production planning and distribution planning are treated separately. However, it is now demonstrated that they are mutually related problems that must be tackled in an integrated way. Hence, in this paper a new integrated production and distribution planning model for perishable products is formulated. The proposed model considers a supply chain network consisting of a production facility and multiple distribution centers. The facility produces a single perishable product that is storable only for predetermined periods. A homogenous fleet of vehicles is responsible for delivering the product from facility to distribution centers. The decisions to be made are the production quantities, the distribution centers that must be visited, and the quantities to be delivered to them. The objective is to minimize the total cost, where the trip minimization is considered simultaneously. As the proposed formulation is computationally complex, a heuristic method is developed to tackle the problem. In the developed method, the problem is divided into production submodel and distribution submodel. The production submodel is solved using LINGO, and a particle swarm heuristic is developed to tackle distribution submodel. Efficiency of the algorithm is proved through a number of randomly generated test problems.",0

In some sense, the description of noncommutative projective curves that was begun in the earlier paper can thus be considered complete.\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a semiprime, Noetherian, connected graded \\(k\\)-algebra of quadratic growth. The description of \\(R\\) in terms of geometric data proceeds, roughly speaking, along the following lines: Let \\(Y\\) be a projective variety of dimension \\(\\leq 1\\) over the base field \\(k\\) and let \\(\\mathcal E\\) be an \\({\\mathcal O}_Y\\)-order in a finite dimensional semisimple algebra \\(A\\) over the field \\(K=k(Y)\\).

A lot of detailed information concerning semiprime graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2 is obtained from this characterization. For example, a finitely generated, semiprime graded Goldie ring \\(S\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S)=2\\) is non-Noetherian if and only if there exists a second layer link from a prime ideal \\(P\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S/P)=1\\) to a maximal ideal \\(M\\) of \\(S\\).","Let (\(\Omega,{\mathcal F},P,({\mathcal F}_ t)_{0\leq t\leq 1})\) be a stochastic basis and \((X_ t)_{0\leq t\leq 1}\) be a cadlag adapted process.

\[
 V_{\tau}(X)=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}| E(X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_ i}| {\mathcal F}_{t_ i\quad})| \text{ and } Q(X)=\sum^{n- 1}_{i=0}(X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_ i})^ 2.
\]
 Then X is called:


a (special) semimartingale) iff \(X=M+A\) where M is a local martingale and A is a (previsible) adapted cadlag process with bounded variation;


a (special) Dirichlet process iff \(X=Z+A\) where Z is a (special) semimartingale and A adapted, continuous, having null quadratic variation (i.e. \(\lim_{| \tau | \to 0}Q_{\tau}(A)=0\) in probability);


a quasimartingale iff \(\{V_{\tau}(X)\); \(\tau\) partition of [0,1]\(\}\) is bounded in \(L^ 1\).


Moreover, the author calls X a prequasimartingale iff the convex hull of \(\{V_{\tau}(X)\); \(\tau\) partition\} is bounded in \(L^ 0\).


The paper has two parts, which are independent. In the first one, the author proves that if X is a Dirichlet process such that the family \(\{Q_{\tau}(X)\); \(\tau\) partition with dyadic points\(\}\) is uniformly integrable, then X is special and its martingale component is in \(H^ 1,\) and applies this result to the study of a Gaussian-Dirichlet process.


In the second part, he shows that, in the class of processes satisfying a supplementary technical condition, the concepts of semimartingale and prequasimartingale are the same, after giving an example that, in general, this is not the case (a prequasimartingale which is not a semimartingale).


The reader is supposed to be familiar with \textit{C. Dellacherie} and \textit{P.-A. Meyer}'s book, Probabilité et potentiel, for the last part till now which appeared 1987 see Zbl 0624.60084, and so the proofs are only sketched (too sketchy, in our opinion). The reader is further frustrated by cryptical references such as ``It is enough to apply La Vallée- Poussin's lemma''; ``Then we apply Yor's remark (a combination of Fefferman and Garsia-Neveu)'' etc. Even the example of a prequasimartingale not being a semimartingale is not clear. Why should the convex hull of \(\{Y_ t|;0\leq t\leq 1\}\) be bounded in \(L^ 0,\) \(Y_ t\) being a cadlag process? Yet, that is the author's argument that his \((Y_ t)_ t\) is a prequasimartingale.

Algebra 184, No. 2, 435-490 (1996; Zbl 0876.17011)], a Noetherian ``twisted homogeneous coordinate ring'' can be constructed as \\(B=\\bigoplus_n H^0(Y,{\\mathcal B}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes{\\mathcal B}^{\\tau^{n-1}})\\). The ring \\(R\\) is then Noetherian if and only if some Veronese subring \\(R^{(m)}\\) of \\(R\\) has the form \\(k+I\\), where \\(I\\) is a left ideal of such a ring \\(B\\) and where \\(I=B\\) at each point \\(p\\in Y\\) at which \\(\\sigma\\) has finite order. A lot of detailed information concerning semiprime graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2 is obtained from this characterization. For example, a finitely generated, semiprime graded Goldie ring \\(S\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S)=2\\) is non-Noetherian if and only if there exists a second layer link from a prime ideal \\(P\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S/P)=1\\) to a maximal ideal \\(M\\) of \\(S\\).","The authors develop the so-called reduced-order extrapolation continuous space-time finite element (CSTFE) method for the two-dimensional unsteady Stokes equation. At first, a transformation of the equation into a form that is suitable for the derivation of the numerical method is done by using stream-vorticity functions. This transformation is followed by a characterization of an approximate solution for the time-discrete problem and some stability as well as error estimates for the solution are shown. Next, the authors introduce a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced order method by assembling the so-called snapshot matrix. The main novelty of their method lies in constructing the snapshot matrix using the classical CSTFE solutions at the first few time nodes and use them to produce the POD basis. This approach helps to reduce the overall computational cost and eliminates the need for repetitive calculations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are shown and stability estimates and convergence properties of the solution are investigated. Numerical results from two computations (square cavity and flow around cylinder problems) using the classical method and the proposed method demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",0
1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group. These objects possess a considerably richer structure; for instance, they are endowed with a non-trivial Lie algebra structure, and the differentials form no longer a complex but fulfil certain\nrelations which reflect in low degrees both the Maurer-Cartan equation and the Bianchi identity.\nIn the paper under review, the authors adapt the approach of \\textit{A. Kock} [Synthetic differential geometry (London Mathematical Lecture Note Series, 51, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc.) (1981; Zbl 0466.51008); Bull. Aust. Math. Soc. 25, 357--386 (1982; Zbl 0484.58005)] to these objects by using the following combinatorial definition. Let \\(X/S\\) be an \\(S\\)-scheme and let \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\subset X^{n+1}\\) be the subscheme of pairwise infinitesimally close \\((n+1)\\)-tuples of points. Then a \\(\\text{Lie}(G)\\) valued \\(n\\)-form, for an \\(S\\)-group scheme \\(G\\), is an \\(S\\)-morphism \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\rightarrow G\\). The authors give a substantial survey of these objects and related results, taking into account several technical subtleties in the general scheme-theoretic context.","The author defines a simplicial differential calculus by generalizing divided differences from the case of curves to the case of general maps, defined on general topological vector spaces, or even on modules over a topological ring \\(\\mathbb K\\). This calculus has the advantage that the number of evaluation points grows linearly with the degree, and not exponentially as in the classical, ``cubic'' approach. In particular, it is better adapted to the case of positive characteristic, where it permits to define Weil functors corresponding to scalar extension from \\(\\mathbb K\\) to truncated polynomial rings \\(\\mathbb K[X]/(X^{k+1})\\).\n\nLet \\(\\mathbb K\\) be a unital commutative topological ring with dense unit group \\(\\mathbb K^\\times \\subset \\mathbb K\\). Let \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) be topological \\(\\mathbb K\\)-modules. Let \\(U\\) be an open subset of \\(V\\). The class of continuous maps is denoted \\(\\mathcal C^{[0]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle 0\\rangle}\\).\n\nA continuous map \\(f: U\\to W\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[1]}\\) if the first order difference map \n\\[\n (x, v, t)\\mapsto \\frac{f(x+tv)-f(x)}{t} \n\\]\n defined for \\(t\\neq 0\\) can be continuously extended to the zero set of \\(t\\). The corresponding extension \\(f^{[1]}: U^{[1]}\\to W\\), where \\(U^{[1]}=\\{(x, v, t)\\in V\\times V\\times \\mathbb K \\mid x\\in U, x+tv\\in U\\}\\), is then unique. One gets the extended tangent map \n\\[\n \\hat T f: U^{[1]}\\to W^{[1]}=W\\times W\\times \\mathbb K, \\quad (x, v, t)\\mapsto (f(x), f^{[1]}(x, v, t), t) \n\\]\n and hence for a fixed \\(t\\) the corresponding map \\(\\hat T^{(t)}f\\). The property \\(\\hat T(f\\circ g)=T(f)\\circ T(g)\\) holds. For \\(\\hat T^{(0)}\\) this gives the chain rule. Moreover, \\(\\hat T^{(t)}\\) commutes with direct products: \\(\\hat T^{(t)}(f\\times g)=\\hat T^{(t)}(f)\\times \\hat T^{(t)}(g)\\).\n\nA map \\(f\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[k+1]}\\) if it is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[k]}\\) and \\(f^{[k]}: U^{[k]}\\to W\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[1]}\\), where \\(f^{[k]}:=(f^{[k-1]})^{[1]}\\). One also gets the higher order extended tangent maps \\(\\hat T^{k} f:= \\hat T(\\hat T^{k-1} f)\\).\n\nNote that \\(\\hat T^n f\\) has \\(2^n\\) arguments from \\(V\\) and \\(2^n-1\\) arguments from \\(\\mathbb K\\). Specializing \\(\\mathbf{t}\\in \\mathbb K^{2^n-1}\\) one obtains the (cubic) \\(\\mathbf{t}\\)-extension \\(T^{(\\mathbf{t})} f\\) of \\(f\\), a map from an open subset \\(T^{(\\mathbf{t})}U\\) in \\(V^{2^n}\\) to \\(W^{2^n}\\). Then \\(T^{(\\mathbf{t})}\\) preserves direct products as well. This way one obtains the cubic differential calculus.\n\nFor a map \\(f: U\\to W\\) and a non-singular \\(\\mathbf{s}\\in \\mathbb K^{k+1}\\), i.~e., \\(s_i-s_j\\in \\mathbb K^\\times\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\), the author defines generalized divided differences by \n\\[\n f^{\\rangle k \\langle}(\\mathbf{v}; \\text\\textbf{s}):= \\frac{f(v_0)}{\\prod_{j=1,\\dots, k}(s_0-s_j)}+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{f(v_0+\\sum_{j=1}^i \\prod_{l=0}^{j-1}(s_i-s_l)v_j)}{\\prod_{j\\neq i, j=0,\\dots, k} (s_i-s_j)}. \n\\]\n A continuous map \\(f: U\\to W\\) is then of class \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle k\\rangle}\\) (\\(k\\) times continuously simplicially differentiable) if \\(f^{\\rangle l \\langle}\\) extends continuously to singular values of \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) for all \\(l=1,\\dots, k\\). In this case there are continuous maps \\(f^{\\langle l \\rangle}: U^{\\langle l \\rangle}\\to W\\), where \\(U^{\\langle l \\rangle}=\\{(\\mathbf{v}, \\text\\textbf{s}) \\mid v_0\\in U, \\forall i=1,\\dots , l:\\;v_0+\\sum_{j=1}^i\\prod_{m=0}^{j-1}(s_i-s_m)v_j\\in U\\}\\) is the the corresponding open subset of \\(V^l\\times \\mathbb K^l\\). For a fixed \\(\\mathbf{s}\\in \\mathbb K^{k+1}\\) one obtains the simplicial \\(\\mathbf{s}\\)-extension of \\(f\\) defined on an open subset \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} U\\) of \\(V^{k+1}\\) \n\\[\n \\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} f: \\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} U\\to W^{k+1}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}\\mapsto (f(v_0), f^{\\langle 1 \\rangle}(v_0, v_1; s_0, s_1), \\dots, f^{\\langle k \\rangle}(\\text\\textbf{v}, \\text\\textbf{s})). \n\\]\n The chain rule \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}(g\\circ f)=\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} (g)\\circ \\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} (f)\\) holds, the products are preserved as well, so \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}\\) is a product preserving functor. This describes the simpicial differential calculus.\n\nIt is shown in Theorem~2.6 that if \\(f\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[k]}\\), then \\(f\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle k\\rangle}\\). The author conjectures that the converse is true as well.\n\nLet \\(F\\) denote one of the functors \\(T^{ (\\mathbf{t}) }\\) or \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}\\) for \\(\\mathbf{t}\\in \\mathbb K^{2^k-1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{s}\\in \\mathbb K^{k+1}\\) respectively. Applying \\(F\\) to the base ring \\(\\mathbb K\\) yields a new ring \\(F\\mathbb K\\), hence these functors can be interpreted as functors of scalar extensions by \\(F\\mathbb K\\). For a map of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[k+m]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle k+m\\rangle}\\) over \\(\\mathbb K\\) the corresponding map \\(F f\\) over \\(F\\mathbb K\\) is of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[m]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle m\\rangle}\\) respectively. Theorem~2.6 implies that there is an embedding of rings \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})} \\mathbb K\\subset T^{(\\mathbf{t})} \\mathbb K\\) (Theorem~3.9).\n\nA manifold over \\(\\mathbb K\\) of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[m]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle m\\rangle}\\) is defined as in [\\textit{W. Bertram, H. GlÃ¶ckner} and \\textit{K.-H. Neeb}, Expo. Math. 22, No. 3, 213--282 (2004; Zbl 1099.58006)] to be a space locally isomorphic to a fixed topological \\(\\mathbb K\\)-module \\(V\\) with the transition functions of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[m]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle m\\rangle}\\) respectively.\n\nTheorem 4.2 extends the functors \\(T^{(\\mathbf{t})}\\), \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}\\) to the category of manifolds with atlas. Namely, for a manifold \\(M\\) with atlas of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[k+m]}\\) or \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle k+m\\rangle}\\) one gets a manifold \\(FM\\) of class \\(\\mathcal C^{[m]}\\) respectively \\(\\mathcal C^{\\langle m\\rangle}\\) over \\(F\\mathbb K\\).\n\nThe functor \\(F\\) is local if for an open subset \\(U\\) of the model space \\(V\\) the corresponding manifold \\(FU=U\\times V^{2^k-1}\\) respectively \\(FU= U\\times V^{k}\\). Theorem~4.2 says that \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}\\) is local for \\(\\mathbf{s}=0\\) and gives sufficient conditions for the locality of \\(T^{(\\mathbf{t})}\\). In the case of local functor \\(F\\), there is a locally trivial bundle \\(FM\\to M\\) with fibre \\(V^{2^k-1}\\) respectively \\(V^{k}\\) such that \\(FM\\) does not depend on the atlas of \\(M\\). In the case of \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^k:=\\mathrm{SJ}^{(\\mathbf{s})}\\), \\(\\mathbf{s}=0\\), one gets the simplicial \\(k\\)-jet bundle \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^k M\\) over \\(\\mathrm{SJ}^k \\mathbb K=\\mathbb K[X]/(X^{k+1})\\). Local functors \\(F\\) of this form are generalizations of the Weil functors from real theory, the corresponding rings generalize the Weil algebras from [\\textit{I. KolÃ¡Å™, P. W.

In Section~2, after a short reminder on basic definitions of the cubic differential calculus, the author develops a simplicial differential calculus. In Section~3 the constructions from Section~2 are interpreted as scalar extension functors. Section~4 deals with the extension of the simplicial differential calculus to the category of manifolds. The relations between the cubic and simplicial calculi is investigated here from the point of view of Weil functors.",1

The norm of \(P\) is the order of the greatest clique in \(P\). Denote by \(\text{cp}(G)\) the minimal cardinality of a clique partition. Given a set \(C\) of \(h\) ``colors'', an \(h\)-coloring of \(P\) in \(G\) is a mapping from \(P\) to \(C\), such that cliques sharing a vertex have different colors.

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Given a convex body \(K \subset {\mathbb R}^n \), the authors formulate definitions of its successive outer radii \( R_i (K) \) and inner radii \( r_i (K) \): For \( i = 1, \ldots n \) let \( R_i (K) = \min_{L \in {\mathcal L}_i^n} R(K \mid L) \), and
\[
 r_i (K) = \max_{ L \in {\mathcal L}_i^n} \left( \max_{x \in L^{\bot}} r(K \cap (x+L); x+L) \right) .

Theorem 1.1. Let \( K, K'\) be convex bodies in \( {\mathbb R}^n \). Then

The semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities are constructed on the quotient space of Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group of corresponding types. Then these quiver varieties are the pull-back of semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities by the quotient map \\(p\\). These quiver varieties are obtained as the symplectic quotients of symplectic vector spaces by a reductive group.

The positive action theorem showed that there were no ALE solutions to Einstein's equations with \\(\\Gamma =0\\) (the most natural analogue of instantons) other than flat space, but \\textit{G. W.

As is well-known, these groups correspond not only to regular solids in \\(R^ 3\\), but to rational double points of algebraic surfaces and Dynkin diagrams of type A, D, E. These features all play a role in the author's construction. The metrics are produced by the hyper-KÃ¤hler quotient construction [\\textit{N. J. Hitchin, A. Karlhede, U. LindstrÃ¶m} and \\textit{M.

The author studies the following question: When is a local holomorphism between real-algebraic submanifolds complex-algebraic? \n\n\nPoincarÃ© was one of the first who studied algebraicity properties of local biholomorphisms between hypersurfaces. He proved that a local biholomorphism between open pieces of 3-spheres in \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is a rational map. This result was extended by \\textit{N. Tanaka} [J. Math. Soc.

The author's exclusive focus is on the first thirteen sentences of Frege's paper, reprinted in translation in Note 1 (p.\ 570). The first, metaphysical, puzzle concerns identity as a logical relation. The second, semantical, puzzle arises out of the expectation that if two sentences say the same thing they ought to be ``cognitive-significance indiscernible'' (p.\ 558). The puzzle is discussed in the cases of proper names (``Cicero\ =\ Cicero'' and ``Cicero\ =\ Tully''), empty names, denoting expressions, and empty descriptions. The third puzzle is related to the theory of cognition. It concerns the question whether certain identity judgements are informative or not, referring to what the author calls ``Frege's Informativeness Theorem'' (p.\ 566): ``(FIT) A true objectual identity judgment `that object\ =\ that object' is informative iff I\(_1\) (that object) is distinct from I\(_2\) (that object)''. This theorem is said to be false based on the claim that informativeness is dependent of the background information given when the judgement is made. This and the other puzzles are no ``genuine puzzles'' as the author argues.",0

Name: text, dtype: object","In this article the author studies different notions of equisingularity for plane curves which are not necessarily reduced, i.e. for generically reduced curves with embedded points. This theory is related with both the theory of equisingularity for plane reduced curves and that for ideals with finite support.\n\n\nIn the first part there is a review of known results on the theory for reduced curves. We can associate to an algebroid plane reduced curve \\(C\\), with branches \\(\\gamma=(\\gamma_1,\\ldots,\\gamma_s)\\) a weighted tree \\(T_1(C,\\gamma)\\) whose vertices are the infinitely near points of \\(C\\), and each vertex has the weight \\((m_1,\\ldots,m_r)\\) of the multiplicities of the strict transforms of the irreducible components at this point. Then two curves are equisingular if they have the same tree.\n\n\nIn the same way we can associate a finite tree \\(\\tau({\\mathcal I})\\) to each \\({\\mathcal M}\\)-primary ideal \\({\\mathcal I}\\) of \\(k[[x,y]]\\), each vertex corresponding to a proper transform of \\({\\mathcal I}\\) and its weight being the multiplicity of the corresponding ideal. In the same way we say that two \\({\\mathcal M}\\)-primary ideals are equisingular if they have the same tree. We note that \\(\\tau({\\mathcal I})=\\tau(\\overline{\\mathcal I})\\), where \\(\\overline{\\mathcal I}\\) is the integral closure of \\({\\mathcal I}\\).\n\n\nAn algebroid plane curve \\(C\\) with embedded point is defined by an ideal \\({\\mathcal I}\\) of \\(R=k[[x,y]]\\), with \\({\\mathcal I}=(f).{\\mathcal N}\\), where \\(f\\in R\\) and either the radical \\(r({\\mathcal N})\\) is the maximal ideal \\({\\mathcal M}\\) or \\({\\mathcal N}=R\\).\n\n\nLet \\(\\pi_1\\colon X_1\\to{\\mathcal A}^2=\\text{Spec}R\\) be the blowing-up of center \\({\\mathcal M}\\), then the intersection \\(E\\cap C_1\\) of the exceptional divisor \\(E\\) with the strict transform \\(C_1\\) of the curve \\(C\\) is a finite set of points \\(\\{ P_1,\\ldots,P_r\\}\\), which are by definition the points in the first neighborhood of \\(C\\). At each point \\(P_i\\), we have either a curve \\(C_i\\) with the same conditions as the curve \\(C\\) in \\({\\mathcal A}^2\\), or we are in the situation of an \\({\\mathcal M}\\)-primary ideal. In any case we can continue the process and we get the infinitely near points of the curve \\(C\\). Then we can associate to the generically reduced curve \\(C\\) defined by an ideal \\({\\mathcal I}\\), a bi-weighted tree \\(T_2(C,\\gamma)=T_2({\\mathcal I},\\gamma)\\), and give the definition of equisingularity: two algebroid, plane, generically reduced curves \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are equisingular if there is an isomorphism of bi-weighted trees \\(T_2(C,\\gamma)\\simeq T_2(D,\\delta)\\), for suitable orderings \\(\\gamma\\), \\(\\delta\\) of the branches of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n\nThe author wants to study one-dimensional families of generically reduced plane curves: \\(X\\subset Z@>\\pi>>T\\), where \\(X\\) is a surface in a smooth threefold \\(Z\\), and \\(p=\\pi_{| X}\\) is flat over the regular curve \\(T\\). In the same way he considers one-dimensional families of ideals \\(({\\mathcal I};\\pi)\\), with \\({\\mathcal I}\\subset {\\mathcal O}_Z\\) and \\(Z@>\\pi>>T\\) smooth. Let \\([{\\mathcal I}]\\) be \\(\\{ z\\in Z:{\\mathcal I}_z\\text{ is not smooth}\\}\\), and define by induction \\(Z_n\\rightarrow Z_{n-1}\\) as the blow-up of \\(S_n=[{\\mathcal I}{\\mathcal O}_{Z_{n-1}}]\\); then we say that the family of ideals is equisingular if for any \\(n \\geq 0\\) the map \\(S_n\\to T\\) is smooth.\n\n\nEven if a family \\(({\\mathcal I};\\pi)\\) is equisingular, it does not follow that the restriction of \\(\\pi\\) at \\(Y\\subset Z\\) defined by \\({\\mathcal I}\\) is flat. To avoid such pathologies it is necessary to consider families of complete ideals. The author studies first a one-dimensional family \\(({\\mathcal I};\\pi)\\) which is equisingular and such that the restriction \\(\\pi_{| Y}\\colon Y\\to T\\) is finite. Then he gets the following result:\n\n\nTheorem: Assume that \\({\\mathcal I}=\\overline{\\mathcal I}\\), i.e. the ideal \\({\\mathcal I}\\) is complete, then \\({\\mathcal I}(t) = \\overline {{\\mathcal I}(t)}\\) for all \\(t\\in T\\).\n\n\nTo get this result we notice that the trees \\(\\tau ( {\\mathcal I}(t))\\) are constant in an equisingular family and that the multiplicity \\(e ({\\mathcal I}(t))\\) of the ideal can be expressed in terms of the weights in \\(\\tau\\), and we use properties of equimultiple families of ideals and the structure of complete ideals in a regular ring of dimension two.\n\n\nFrom this theorem the author deduces that an equisingular family of complete ideals \\(({\\mathcal I};\\pi)\\) is properly flat, i.e. all maps \\(Y_n \\rightarrow T\\) are flat where \\(Y_n \\subset Z_n\\) are defined by the strict transform of \\({\\mathcal I}\\) in \\(Z_n\\), where \\(Z_n\\) is obtained by the ``resolution process'' defined previously. \n\n\nIn the last part the author introduces three notions of equisingularity for one-dimensional families of generically reduced curves \\(X \\subset Z@>\\pi>>T\\), such that the ``singular locus'' \\( [{\\mathcal I} (X) ]\\) is finite over \\(T\\). The family is ``I-equisingular'' if the family of ideals \\(({\\mathcal I}(X);\\pi)\\) is equisingular; the family is ``T-equisingular'' if for any pair of points \\(t,t'\\in T\\) the fibers \\(X_t\\) and \\(X_{t'}\\) are equisingular, i.e. they have the same tree \\(T_2\\); the family is ``\\(C\\)-equisingular'' if it is ``\\(I\\)-equisingular'' and properly flat, i.e. the maps \\(X_n \\rightarrow T\\) are flat where \\(X_n\\) is the proper transform of \\(X\\) in \\(Z_n\\). Then we have the following:\n\n\nTheorem: The notions of ``\\(I\\)-equisingularity'' and of ``\\(T\\)-equisingularity'' are equivalent; moreover if the ideal \\({\\mathcal I}\\) of \\(X\\) in \\(Z\\) is complete they are also equivalent to ``\\(C\\)-equisingularity''.",1

1021586,"Summary: The problem of counting the number of lattice points inside a lattice polytope in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) has been studied from a variety of perspectives, including the recent work of Pommersheim and Kantor-Khovanskii using toric varieties and Cappell-Shaneson using Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch. Here we show that the Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice \\(n\\)-simplex has a simple analytical interpretation from the perspective of Fourier Analysis on the \\(n\\)-torus. We obtain closed forms in terms of cotangent expansions for the coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial, that shed additional light on previous descriptions of the Ehrhart polynomial.","Summary: This note gives an expansion for summing the values of a function on lattice points contained in a polytope with vertices in the lattice or at least rational with respect to it. This expansion involves integrals of linear differential operators with constant coefficients, applied to the function. The coefficients are computed starting from volumes of faces and angles in which they meet. This is done using a construction of some new algebras, generalizing the Chow ring but also containing infinitesimal data, and an analogue of the Todd class of toric varieties is calculated in these algebras.",1
1371474,"The formal Brauer groups arising from certain K3 surfaces in weighted projective \\(3\\)-spaces are studied. Here the varieties are defined over base rings \\(k,\\) where \\(k\\) is either an algebraically closed field of characteristic \\(p>0\\) or a Noetherian ring which is flat and of finite type over \\(\\mathbb Z\\). In the case where \\(k\\) is an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, the height of a formal Brauer group is an integer between 1 and 10, provided the formal group is of finite height. The authors provide K3 surfaces with formal Brauer groups of heights 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10. Many examples are provided, in terms of the field characteristic and the weightings. When \\(k\\) is a Noetherian ring that is flat and of finite type over \\(\\mathbb Z\\), the author discusses the issue of representing a formal Brauer group arising from a weighted diagonal (or quasi-diagonal) \\(K3\\) surface by a formal group law. The formal group law is described in terms of its logarithm. Finally, an analogue of the Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruence for elliptic curves is proved for these K3 surfaces.","This paper deals with the quantum particle systems interacting through \(k\)-body forces and creation-annihilation processes which do not preserve the number of particles. Particularly, it concerns the essential spectrum and the Mourre estimate for the systems. Its approach is based on the observation that the \(C^*\)-algebra \(\mathcal{C} \) generated by a class of physically interesting Hamiltonians has a simple structure which allows one to describe its quotient with respect to the ideal of compact operators in explicit terms. This structure of \(\mathcal{C}\) is used to deduce certain spectral properties of the Hamiltonians.",0
1700852,"The author classifies all possible configurations of singular fibers and the torsion parts of Mordell-Weil groups of complex elliptic \\(K3\\) surfaces, using the lattice-theoretic approach provided by the Torelli theorem for \\(K3\\).

1591107,"From the introduction: Let \\(p,q:\\mathbb{C}^2\\to\\mathbb{C}\\) be two polynomials.

One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S.

Let us recall that, if \\(M\\) is a compact finite dimensional Riemannian manifold and \\(\\{\\psi_n\\}_{1\\leq n\\leq \\infty}\\) is an orthonormal basis in \\(L^2(M)\\), consisting of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian \\(\\triangle\\) of \\(M\\), to each \\(\\psi_n\\), a measure \\(\\bar\\mu(\\psi_n)=|\\psi_n|^2\\,d\\rho\\) can be associated, or a distribution, on \\(M\\). Here, \\(d\\rho\\) is the canonical measure on the Riemannian manifold \\(M\\). Let \\(S^*M\\subset T^*M\\) be the unit cotangent bundle on \\(M\\). To each \\(\\psi_n\\), one can associate a distribution \\(\\mu(\\psi_n)\\) on \\(S^*M\\) projecting to \\(\\bar\\mu(\\psi_n)\\) (microlocal lift) (A. I. Shnirel'man (1974)). A measure \\(\\mu\\) on \\(S^*M\\) is called a (microlocal) quantum limit if it is a weak-limit of a sequence of distributions \\(\\mu_n\\), microlocal lift of a sequence of eigenfunctions \\(\\psi_n\\) with \\(|\\lambda_n|\\to \\infty\\), where \\(\\lambda_n\\) is an eigenvalue for the eigenfunction \\(\\psi_n\\).\n\nThe following theorem characterizes the quantum limit (Shnirel'man-Zelditch (1986), Colin de VerdiÃ¨re (1985)). Let the eigenfunctions \\(\\{\\psi_n\\}_{1\\leq n\\leq \\infty}\\) be ordered by increasing eigenvalues. Then:\n{\\parindent7mm\n\\begin{itemize}\\item[(1)] \\(\\text{weak-lim}_{N\\to\\infty}{{1}\\over{N}}\\sum_{1\\leq n\\leq N}\\mu_n=d\\lambda\\), where \\(d\\lambda\\) is the Liouville measure on \\(S^*M\\); \n\\item[(2)] if the geodesic flow on \\(S^*M\\) is ergodic, there exists a subsequence \\(\\{\\psi_k\\}_{1\\leq k\\leq \\infty}\\) of density~1, such that \\(\\text{weak-lim}_{k\\to\\infty}\\mu_k=d\\lambda\\). For this subsequence, \\(\\text{weak-lim}_{k\\to\\infty}\\bar\\mu_k=d\\rho\\). \n\n\\end{itemize}}\n\nSince it is well-known that the geodesic flow on a manifold of (constant) negative curvature is ergodic (E. Hopf (1939), D. V. Anosov (1967)), the following conjecture has been stated. \n\n(Rudnick-Sarnak's quantum unique ergodicity conjecture (1994)) Let \\(M\\) be a compact manifold of strictly negative sectional curvature. Then \\(\\bar\\mu_n\\) weakly converges to the measure \\(d\\rho\\) and \\(d\\lambda\\) is the unique quantum limit on \\(S^*M\\). \n\nIf \\(M\\) is a hyperbolic surface of constant negative curvature, the universal cover \\(\\widetilde{M}\\) of \\(M\\) is the upper half-plane: \\(\\widetilde{M}\\cong {\\mathbb H}\\equiv\\{z=x+iy\\in\\mathbb C\\mid y>0\\}\\subset\\mathbb C\\). The group \\(\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb R)\\) acts on \\(\\mathbb H\\) by MÃ¶bius transformations. One has \\(\\mathbb H\\backsimeq \\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R)/\\text{SO}_2(\\mathbb R)\\), and the isomorphism \\(S^*M\\cong X\\), where \\(X\\equiv \\Gamma\\backslash\\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R) \\to M=\\Gamma\\backslash{\\mathbb H}\\) is the \\(\\text{SO}_2(\\mathbb R)\\simeq S^1\\) bundle, for a uniform lattice (congruence lattice) \\(\\Gamma< \\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R)\\). Then the geodesic flow on \\(S^*M\\) is parametrized by the action of the maximal split torus on \\(X\\). Furthermore, there are additional operators (Hecke operators) \\(T_p: L^2(X)\\to L^2(X)\\), for each prime \\(p\\) (except for a finite set of ramified primes) commuting with the right action of \\(\\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R)\\). \\(T_p\\) acts also on functions on \\(M\\) and commutes with \\(\\triangle\\). The Hecke-Maass forms are just the joint eigenfunctions of all the Hecke operators \\(T_p\\) and \\(\\triangle\\). An arithmetic quantum limit is a quantum limit \\(\\mu_\\infty\\) obtained from micro-local lifts of Hecke-Maass forms. The arithmetic quantum chaos problem is the classification of such limits. One has the following theorem (Lindenstrauss-theorem (2003)). Let \\(M=\\Gamma\\backslash{\\mathbb H}\\) be a congruence quotient, and \\(\\mu_\\infty\\) an arithmetic quantum limit on \\(X=\\Gamma\\backslash \\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb R)\\simeq S^*M\\).

If \\(\\Gamma\\) is co-compact (i.e., arising from a quaternionic algebra), then \\(c=1\\). \n\nIn particular, the author considers quantum unique ergodicity for the modular surface \\(M\\equiv\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)\\backslash{\\mathbb H}\\). The main result is a proof of Rudnick-Sarnak's quantum unique ergodicity for normalized Hecke-Maass forms \\(\\phi\\) on \\(M\\) (hence with unitary Peterson norm: \\(\\int_M|\\phi(z)|^2{{1}\\over{y^2}}\\,dx\\, dy=1\\)). In other words, for every Maass form \\(\\phi\\) the corresponding measure \\(\\mu(\\phi)\\) approaches the uniform distribution measure \\({{3}\\over{\\pi}}{{1}\\over{y^2}}\\,dx\\, dy\\) as \\(\\lambda\\to\\infty\\). (This generalizes a result by S. Zelditch (1991) for a typical Maass form \\(\\phi\\), that is, the \\(L^2\\)-mass is uniformly spread out over a fundamental domain of \\(\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)\\backslash{\\mathbb H}\\).) \n\nLindenstrauss' results prove that the only possible weak limits of the measure \\(\\mu(\\phi)\\) are the forms \\(c\\, \\left(\\frac 3{\\pi}\\right)\\left(\\frac 1{y^2}\\right)\\,dx\\,dy\\), where \\(c\\) is some constant in \\([0,1]\\). Therefore, Lindenstrauss established quantum unique ergodicity for \\(M\\) except for the possibility that, for some infinite sequence of Hecke-Maass forms \\(\\phi\\), some of the \\(L^2\\) mass of \\(\\phi\\) could ``escape'' into the cusp of \\(M\\). In this paper, the author eliminates the possibility of the escape of mass, and, therefore, he is able to complete the proof of quantum unique ergodicity for \\(M\\). \n\nThe paper, after a detailed introduction (where are summarized the main result, the principal steps for its proof and enough references to where the reader can find more accounts of the quantum unique ergodicity problem), splits into three more sections. 2. Deducing Theorem 1 and Proposition 2 from Theorem 3. (Theorem 3 and Proposition 2 are intermediate results used to obtain the main result contained in Theorem 1.) 3. Preliminaries for the proof of Theorem 3. Proof of Theorem 3. \n\nRemark: Let us emphasize that the Rudnick-Sarnak conjecture proven in this paper for the modular surface \\(M\\equiv \\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)\\backslash{\\mathbb H}\\) is of great interest in number theory. In fact, the study of functions on \\(\\mathbb H\\) that are invariant (or have a suitable transformation) under the action of \\(\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb Z)\\) is related to modular forms. The latter are related to the well-known Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (1955), proved by A. Wiles (1995), since it states that all rational elliptic curves are also modular ones. The proof of this conjecture allowed \\textit{A. Wiles} to prove also Fermat's last theorem about the non-existence of integer solutions of the Diophantine equation \\(x^n+y^n=z^n\\), \\(n>2\\), \\(x,y,z\\neq 0\\). (Important subjects, related to the theory of cusp modular forms, and, hence to this paper, are the Ramanujan's conjecture (1920) and Weil's conjecture (1949), proven by P. Deligne (1973--74).)",1

1454438,"Summary: We show that the decidability of an amplification of Hilbert's Tenth Problem in three variables implies the existence of uncomputably large integral points on certain algebraic curves. We obtain this as a corollary of a new positive complexity result: the Diophantine prefix \\(\\exists \\forall \\exists\\) is generically decidable. This means that we give a precise geometric classification of those polynomials \\(f \\in\\mathbb{Z}[v,x,y]\\) for which the question \n\\[\n\\exists v \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ such that } \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ with } f(v,x,y)=0?\n\\]\n may be undecidable, and we show that this set of polynomials is quite small in a rigorous sense. (The decidability of \\(\\exists \\forall \\exists\\) was previously an open question.) We also show that if integral points on curves can be bounded effectively, then \\(\\exists \\exists \\forall \\exists\\) is generically decidable as well. We thus obtain a connection between the decidability of certain Diophantine problems, height bounds for points on curves, and the geometry of certain complex surfaces and 3-folds.","Theorem.

These quiver varieties are important objects for the study of simple singularities. Let \\(p\\) be the quotient map of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group. The semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities are constructed on the quotient space of Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group of corresponding types. Then these quiver varieties are the pull-back of semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities by the quotient map \\(p\\).

The results present a sharp contrast with some of the results of [\textit{M. Lipnowski} and \textit{J. Tsimerman}, Duke Math. J. 167, No. 18, 3403--3453 (2018; Zbl 1426.11062)], which are concerned with (principally) polarised abelian varieties. In that case it turns out that at least for most primes \(p\), almost all principally polarised abelian varieties are isogenous to a product involving \(E^h\) (for some elliptic curve \(E\)) with \(h\) very close to \(g\). What is shown here is that, on the contrary, without the polarisation almost all isogeny classes are simple.

More precisely, if \(m_q(g)\) and \(s_q(g)\) denote the number of isogeny classes, respectively simple isogeny classes, of abelian \(g\)-folds over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), then it is shown that \(s_q(g)=q^{\frac{1}{4}g^2(1+o(1))}\) (the same is true for \(m_q(g)\), by well-known results), and that \(\limsup\limits_{g\to\infty}\frac{s_q(g)}{m_q(g)}=1\). This second result follows fairly easily from the first and a result to the effect that most isogeny classes have a large simple factor: for any \(\varepsilon >0\) one has \(\lim\limits_{g\to\infty}\frac{a_L(q,g.\varepsilon)}{m_q(g)}=1\), where \(a_L(q,g,\varepsilon)\) is the number of isogeny classes containing a simple factor of dimension \((1-\varepsilon)g\).

The basis for the results is the Honda-Tate theorem: rather than counting isogeny classes directly, one counts characteristic polynomials of Frobenius on the Tate module over \(\mathbb{Q}_\ell\). The actual proofs are then obtained by the astute use of more or less elementary methods.",0

\[
 \mathcal G [u] := G(\cdot, u, Du)\quad \text{\(\partial \Omega\)}.

 Here \(Du\) and \(D^2u\) denote the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of the solution \(u \in C^2(\Omega)\), \(A\) is an \(n \times n\) symmetric matrix function defined on \(\Omega \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n\), \(B\) is a scalar function on \(\Omega \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n\) and \(G\) is a scalar function defined on \(\partial\Omega \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n\). The function \(F\) is defined on an open convex cone with vertex at \(0\) containing the positive cone in the linear space of \(n\times n\) symmetric matrices satisfying appropriate convexity. For \(G \in C^1(\partial\Omega \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n)\), the boundary condtion is said to be oblique if \(G_p\cdot \nu >0\) for all of \(\partial\Omega \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n\), where \(\nu\) is the unit inner normal vector field on \(\partial \Omega\).

First, the authors obtain a local/global second derivative estimate which extends the Monge-Ampère case in [\textit{X.-N. Ma} et al., Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 177, No. 2, 151--183 (2005; Zbl 1072.49035)]. More precisely, assuming a natural convexity condition of the domain together with appropriate convexity conditions on the matrix function \(F\) in the augmented Hessian, the authors show that if \(u \in C^4(\Omega)\) is an admissible solution of the augmented Hessian equation, then for any domains \(\Omega'\subset\subset \Omega_0\) in \({\mathbb R}^n\), \(A \in C^2(\overline\Omega\times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n)\) is strictly regular in \(\overline \Omega \cap \Omega_0\), and if \(B \in C^2(\overline\Omega \cap \Omega_0 \times {\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^n)\), \(B > a_0\), then
\[
 \sup_{\Omega \cap \Omega'} |D^2u| \leq \sup_{\partial\Omega \cap \Omega_0} |D^2u| +C.
\]
 Recall that the matrix function \(A\) is called strictly regular at \(x \in \overline\Omega\) if \(A\) satisfies

\[A^{kl}_{ij}(x,z, p) \xi_i \xi_j \eta_k\eta_l >0\] for all \(\xi, \eta \in {\mathbb R}^n\), \(\xi \perp \eta\), where \(A^{kl}_{ij} = D^2_{p_kp_l}A_{ij}\). In the case \(\Omega' = \Omega\), the estimate provides a global estimate which reduces the bound for the second derivative to the boundary. When \(\Omega_0 = \Omega\), we can get the usual form of the interior estimate, which is already formulated for some case in [\textit{N. S. Trudinger}, in: Proceedings of the international congress of mathematicians (ICM), Madrid, Spain, August 22--30, 2006. Volume III: Invited lectures.

Second, assuming appropriate geometric assumptions on the domain \(\Omega\) which provides a boundary estimate for the  solutions \(u \in C^4(\Omega)\cap C^3(\overline{\Omega})\), the authors prove the following global second  derivative bound
\[
 \sup_\Omega |D^2 u| \leq C.
\]
 The authors also show a gradient estimate for the solutions \( u\in C^4(\Omega)\cap C^3(\overline{\Omega})\) under further conditions on \(A\) or \(F\).

Finally, applying the second  derivative estimate and the gradient estimate, the authors obatin the existence of smooth solutions \(u \in C^{3, \alpha}(\overline{\Omega})\) to the oblique boundary value problem of the augmented Hessian equation.",0

It is a three-dimensional arithmetical chaotic non-Euclidean billiard, realized by a point particle sliding freely on the fundamental domain of the Picard group \\(PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}[i])\\).\n\n\nThe corresponding quantum system is governed by the three-dimensional non-Euclidean SchrÃ¶dinger-equation. The eigenfunctions have to satisfy periodic boundary conditions. We are also interested in the desymmetrized systems, where only those eigenfunctions are considered, which are satisfying Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. While those systems, which are satisfying Neumann or periodic boundary conditions have both a discrete and a continuous spectrum, the desymmetrized systems with Dirichlet boundaries on at least one surface possess only a discrete spectrum.\n\n\nIn this paper we calculate the first 180 000 periodic orbits for the Picard billiard. The Selberg trace formulas and the Selberg zeta functions for the desymmetrized systems are derived.\n\n\nA quantization rule based on an analytic continuation of the Selberg zeta functions to the critical line is given, and with this quantization rule the first eigenvalues are computed.","Let \(F_m(\mathfrak M)\) be the relatively free algebra of rank \(m\geq 2\) in the nonlocally nilpotent variety \(\mathfrak M\) of Lie algebras over an infinite field of any characteristic.

1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group. These objects possess a considerably richer structure; for instance, they are endowed with a non-trivial Lie algebra structure, and the differentials form no longer a complex but fulfil certain\nrelations which reflect in low degrees both the Maurer-Cartan equation and the Bianchi identity.\nIn the paper under review, the authors adapt the approach of \\textit{A. Kock} [Synthetic differential geometry (London Mathematical Lecture Note Series, 51, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc.) (1981; Zbl 0466.51008); Bull. Aust. Math.

The curvature of the connection measures the compatibilities of these parallel transports around infinitesimal closed loops in the base space \\(X\\). It is a global 2-form on \\(X\\) with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group of \\(P\\) and satisfies the Bianchi identity. \n\nJust as principal bundles are geometric realizations of \\(G\\)-valued 1-cocycles, a gerbe on \\(X\\) is the geometric embodiment of a 2-cocycle on \\(X\\) with values in a non-abelian group. The authors of the paper show how to define the corresponding concepts of connection and curvature for a gerbe \\(\\mathcal P\\) on \\(X\\). When the gerbe is endowed with trivializing data with respect to an open cover of \\(X\\), they describe this connective structure in two separate ways, which extend from abelian to general gerbes the corresponding descriptions due to \\textit{J.-L.

These quiver varieties are important objects for the study of simple singularities. Let \\(p\\) be the quotient map of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group. The semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities are constructed on the quotient space of Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group of corresponding types. Then these quiver varieties are the pull-back of semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities by the quotient map \\(p\\). These quiver varieties are obtained as the symplectic quotients of symplectic vector spaces by a reductive group. So the coordinate rings are invariant subrings of polynomial rings with respect to the action of the group.

Algebra 166, 125-148 (2002; Zbl 1001.15022)] is used.","By using \(C^*\) deformation of \textit{M. A. Rieffel} [Deformation quantization for actions of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Mem. Am. Math. Soc. 506 Soc. (1993; Zbl 0798.46053)], the noncommutative spheres \(\mathbb{S}_\theta^{2l}\) of \textit{A. Connes} and \textit{G. Landi} [Commun. Math. Phys. 221, 141-159 (2001; Zbl 0997.81045)] are shown to be quantum homogeneous spaces for quantum groups, Rieffel's \(C^*\)-deformation of \(SO(2l+1)\) for \(l\geq 2\). This is shown as an application of a more general Theorem.


For this purpose, noncommutative spheres of Connes and Landi are reviewed in Section 2 as solutions of equations for the Chern character. In Section 3, Rieffel's \(C^*\)-deformation theory is reviewed. The \(C^*\)-deformation of \(C^\infty(M)\), \(M\) a compact Riemannian manifold carries an isometric action of the torus \(\mathbb{T}^l\), \(l\geq 2\), is built taking a skew-symmetric \(l\times l\) matrix \(J\) and introducing a generalization of the Moyal product for the elements of \(C^*(M)\) by using \(J\). Its completion by Rieffel's metric is the \(C^*\)-deformed algebra \(A_J\).


In Section 4, this construction is applied to a compact Lie group \(G\). In this case, \(\mathbb{T}^l\) is a closed abelian subgroup \(H\) of \(G\). \(J\) is a skewsymmetric matrix acting on \({\mathfrak h}\oplus {\mathfrak h}\), where \({\mathfrak h}\) is the Lie algebra of \(H\). To quantize group structure of \(G\), \(J\) is assumed to be of type \(Q\oplus (-Q)\), \(Q\) a skewsymmetric matrix. Then \(A_J\) is shown to be a compact quantum group in the sense of [\textit{S. Woronowicz} [Symétries quantiques, Les Houches, 1995, 845-884 (1998; Zbl 0997.46045)]. The \(C^*\)-deformation of a homogeneous space \(G/K\), \(K\) a closed subgroup of \(G\) containing \(H\), is treated in Section 5, and it is shown that the \(C^*\)-deformation of \(G/K\) is an embedded homogeneous space of the compact quantum group \(A_J\) (Section 5, Theorem 1). Taking \(G=SO(2l+1)\), \(K=SO(2l)\) and \(H\simeq \mathbb{T}^l\), the first mentioned fact follows.


In Section 6, the spectral triple associated with the \(C^*\)-deformation of \(G/K\) is discussed and the author remarks that when applied to quantum field theory, the above constructed deformation never softens the ultraviolet divergence.",0

If \(X\) is a connected, locally path connected and semi-locally simply connected, separable metric space with finite covering dimension \(\dim X<\infty\) and with the homotopy type of a \(CW\)-complex, \(Y\) is a connected, locally path connected and semi-locally simply connected space with the homotopy type of a finite dimensional \(CW\)-complex, and \(\pi:X\to Y\) is a Hurewicz fibration, then the authors prove that if at least one fiber \(F\) is locally contractible and \(X\) is aspherical, then the universal covering space \(Y'\) of \(Y\) is \(\mathbb K\)-acyclic for any field \(\mathbb K\), and if \(\widetilde{\Omega_yY}\) is the connected component of the loop space of \(Y\) containing the constant loop \(C_y=y\), \(X\) is aspherical, and the fiber \(F=\pi^{-1}(y)\) is a finite-dimensional \(CW\)-complex, then \(H_k(\widetilde{\Omega_yY},\mathbb K)=0\) for every \(k>\dim X\) and for any field \(\mathbb K\).

Smooth manifolds are finite-dimensional separable metric spaces and also finite-dimensional \(CW\)-complexes, so to investigate topological properties of Hurewicz fibrations is to get information on maps between compact Riemannian manifolds under curvature restrictions. A point \(p\in M\) is critical for the \(C^1\)-map \(f:M\to N\) if \(f\) is not submersive at \(p\).

As consequences of the main results, the authors show that if \(f:M\to N\) is a smooth map between the compact Riemannian manifolds \((M,g)\) and \((N,h)\) of dimension \(m\) and \(n\), respectively, and \(\text{Sect}_M\leq 0\) and \(\text{Ric}_N\geq(n-1)K>0\), then \(f\) must have a critical point.

This is a textbook on finite model theory that gains much of its motivation from the tight connections between this field and the field of computer science, as can best be exemplified in computational complexity theory, database theory, and formal language theory.

After an introduction with examples taken from the just mentioned areas and after pointing out that prominent results from traditional model theory (compactness theorem, Löwenheim-Skolem theorem) do not hold in the finite setting, the author turns to a development of the main tools that are important here: Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games (chap.~3) and locality (chap.~4). An important topic in the study of the expressive power of first-order logic is whether the universe is ordered. This is the focus of chap.~5. Most of the subsequent chapters study the expressive power of first-oder logic (chap.~6) and some of its extensions: monadic second-order logic (chap.~7), counting quantifiers (chap.~8), fixed-point operators (chaps.~10 and 11). An intermediate chapter (9) addresses the principles of encoding Turing machines as finite structures from a somewhat more general point of view. The remaining three chapters study zero-one laws, hybrid structures, and further applications of finite model theory in computer science.

The audience of the book, as intended by the author, is formed by theoretical computer scientists. This does not mean, however, that a computer science background is a prerequisite. It just means that the book is a basic textbook on finite model theory that presents the most important results from the field (though, in my personal opinion, an imporant topic, the connection between FO and uniform circuit complexity, is missing) in a way accessible with only very basic acquaintance with mathematics or traditional logics. It contains a chapter with a very brief introduction of important concepts from logic, formal languages, computability, and complexity. Every chapter ends with a set of exercises ranging from immediately solvable to research problems.

The main ingredient is the language of Lie algebras, meaning differential graded Lie algebras, their representations, and certain complexes associated to these, called Jacobi complexes. \n\nGeometry is conveniently described by symmetry groups, so a similar thing should be true for deformations of a geometric object. Infinitesimal variations of gluing data on a topological space \\(X\\) can be described in terms of Lie algebras \\(L\\), consequently infinitesimal deformations of geometric structures can be systematically expressed in terms of a sheaf of Lie algebras on \\(X\\). Such sheaves plays a fundamental role in this work. \n\nOne of the main tools developed in this article is a direct cohomological construction, in terms of the moduli problem, of the vector fields and differential operators on moduli spaces, together with their action on functions, as well as on modular modules, that is, those associated to the moduli problem, including formulae for composition and Lie bracket. \n\nThe author obtains a canonical formula for the Lie algebra of vector fields on a moduli space together with its natural representation on functions, as well as extensions to the case of differential operators acting on modular vector bundles. \n\nThe author starts with the construction of modular modules. Then a formal study of connections on moduli spaces is introduced by identifying a class of Lie algebras called connection algebras which is universal with respect to the presence of an integrable connection over their deformation spaces. \n\nThese methods are applied to study the relation between the geometry of a given complex manifold \\(X\\) and that of a moduli space \\(\\mathcal{M}_X\\) of vector bundles on \\(X\\). The author proves that it is a Lie homomorphism \\(\\Sigma_X\\) from the differential graded Lie algebra associated to \\(T_X\\) to that of \\(T_{\\mathcal{M}_X}\\). Because a Lie homomorphims induces a map on the associated deformation spaces, \\(\\Sigma_X\\) can be used to relate deformations of \\(X\\) to those of \\(\\mathcal{M}_X\\). \n\nWhen \\(X\\) is a compact Riemann surface, \\(\\Sigma_X\\) factors through a Lie homomorphism to a certain Lie-theoretic object called the Lie atom associated to \\(\\mathcal{M}_X\\). This leads to a construction of the Hitchin or Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov flat connection over the moduli of curves. The author is then able to extend the Welters-Hitchin construction, which is essentially plain first-order deformation theory, to the Lie-theoretic context, via a connection algebra. This yields a transparent proof that the connection thus obtained is automatically flat, a second-order conclusion modulo showing that the relevant maps are Lie homomorphisms. Thus the author obtains an algebraic proof of the flatness condition in contrary to Hitchin which uses arguments from symplectic geometry. \n\nThe author certainly illustrates the deformation-theoretic usefulness of a philosophy familiar in Lie theory, that a Lie algebra framework allows automatic passage from first order to arbitrary order. \n\nThe author treats in a very nice way moduli modules, the modules resulting in the moduli ring, and the tangent Lie algebra of vector fields on a moduli space. The main result is the definition of this algebra and its differential operators. Tickenings and its relative version is also well treated. Finally, Lie atoms are discussed in an understandable manner as a generalization of the quotient of a Lie algebra by a subalgebra. \n\nThe article can not be said to be self contained, and some knowledge of the earlier results of the author seems convenient.",1

Namely, Theorem 6.2.1 gives the complete description of \\(V_{G_1}(H^0(\\lambda))\\) in case of good characteristic for any dominant weight \\(\\lambda \\). Moreover, some other applications are considered.\n\n\nSection 7 is devoted to the research of support varieties for \\(Z_r(\\lambda)\\) and \\(L(\\lambda)\\). As a motivation of further results the case \\(G=GL_3,~p\\geq 3\\) is considered in detail (Prop. 7.1.1).

In case \(E\) is uniformizable we show that this extension module is canonically isomorphic with the corresponding extension module of Pink-Hodge structures.

\[
(1)\quad a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n=0

 mit lauter positiven Koeffizienten \(a_i\) nur Wurzeln mit reellen negativen Bestandteilen besitzt. Die Bedingung besteht darin, daß sämtliche Determinanten, die nach einem gewissen Gesetze aus einer gegebenen Determinante gebildet werden, positiv sind. \textit{Orlando}, der, wie einst \textit{Hurwitz}, durch technische Probleme zur Behandlung derselben Frage geführt ist, gibt in der ersten Note ein anderes übersichtliches Kriterium. Er bildet die Gleichung vom Grade \(\frac12\,n(n-1)\), die als Wurzeln die Halbsummen \(\frac\,12(x_i+x_k)\) aller Wurzeln von (1) hat (\(i\neq k\)). Dies kann mit Hülfe der \textit{Newton}schen Summenformeln für \(\sum x_i^m\) unschwer geschehen. Diese Gleichung nennt er ``Gleichung für die Halbsummen'' und beweist dann den Satz: Die notwendige und hinreichende Bedingung dafür, daß d ie Gleichung (1) mit reellen Koeffizienten nur negative Wurzeln und komplexe Wurzeln mit negativen reellen Bestandteilen hat, besteht darin, daß alle ihre Koeffizienten von Null verschieden und von gleichem Vorzeichen sind, und daß auch alle Koeffizienten der zugehörigen Gleichung für die Halbsummen von Null verschieden und von gleichem Vorzeichen sind.

In der zweiten Note wird die \textit{Hurwitz}sche Determinante \(D\) von der Ordnung \(n\) bezüglich des Polynoms \(f(x)\) betrachtet:
\[
(2)\quad D=\left|\begin{matrix} a_1\;a_0\quad 0\quad 0\quad & \dots & 0 \\ a_3 \;a_2\;a_1\;a_0 & \dots & 0 \\ a_5\;a_4\;a_3\;a_2 & \dots & 0 \\ a_7\;a_6\;a_5\;a_4 & \dots & 0 \\ \hdotsfor3 \\ 0\quad 0\quad 0\quad 0\quad & \dots & a_n \end{matrix} \right|.
\]
 Nun hat man
\[
f(x+y)=\frac{f^{(n)}(y)}{n!}x^n+\frac{f^{(n-1)}(y)}{(n-1)!}\;x^{n-1}+\cdots +f'(y)x+f(y).
\]
 Ersetzt man in \(D\) die \(a_i\) durch \(\frac{f^{(i)}y}{i!}\), so geht aus \(D\) eine neue Determinante \(Q(y)\) hervor. Für sie gilt der Satz: Die notwendige und hinreichende Bedingung dafür, daß die Gleichung (1) \(f(x)=0\) nur negative reelle Wurzeln und komplexe Wurzeln mit negativen reellen Bestandteilen hat, besteht darin, daß außer \(f(x)\) auch das Polynom \(Q(y)\) in der Variable \(y\) alle Koeffizienten von Null verschieden und von gleichem Vorzeichen hat.

In der dritten Note wird gezeigt, daß die beiden Methoden der ersten und der zweiten Note wesentlich auf dasselbe hinauslaufen. Außerdem wird mit viel elementareren Mitteln als bei \textit{Hurwitz} das von diesem aufgestellte Theorem bewiesen.

 Gleich nach der Veröffentlichung der ersten Note hatte \textit{Marcolongo} den Verf. auf eine Stelle in der Dynamik von \textit{Routh} aufmerksam gemacht, wo dasselbe Problem vor \textit{Hurwitz} bei einer Gleichung vierten Grades nach einer anderen Methode behandelt ist. In der vierten Note wird gezeigt, wie man durch Verallgemeinerung des \textit{Routh}schen Verfahrens auf Gleichungen \(n\)-ten Grades sowohl zur Gleichung für die Halbsummen, als auch zur \textit{Hurwitz}schen Determinante gelangt.",0

Next, he discusses inductive limits of Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras. The main results of the paper concern free products of Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras. First, it is shown that on the free product of two Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras amalgamated over a common Woronowicz \(C^*\)-subalgebra there is a natural structure of a Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras, and this is actually the amalgamated free product in the category of Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras. Next, the author shows that the Haar state on a free product of Woronowicz \(C^*\)-algebras (amalgamated over the scalars) is the free product of the Haar states of the factors and he describes the irreducible representations of such a free product.

He shows that these are pairwise non-isomorphic (even as \(C^*\)-algebras) and that they are not nuclear and thus cannot be isomorphic to \(U_q(m)\) or \(\mathrm{SU}_q(m)\).",0

In contrast to the general approach established by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [Int. J. Math. 6, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004); J. Algebr.

Such a family is also called a (local) deformation of the germ of curve \\((X_0,0)\\), the fiber at \\(0\\). There is an induced family \\(f^u:(X^u,0) \\to ({\\mathbb C}^k,0)\\), where \\((X^u,0)\\) is the \\textit{unmixed} subgerm (or part) of \\((X,0)\\) (i.e., the union of the irreducible components of maximum dimension of \\((X_{\\mathrm{red}},0)\\).)\n\nThen it is proved that \\(f^u\\) is again flat and the deformation it defines is \\(\\delta\\)-constant if and only if \\(f^u\\) is equinormalizable.\n\nThe concepts of \\textit{unmixed part}, \\(\\delta\\)-\\textit{invariant} and \\textit{equinormalizable morphism} are reviewed by the author.\n\n\\textit{G. M. Greuel} and the author have obtained (in an article in preparation) similar results for families of curves which are not necessarily planar, but the methods required are different. The similar problem in case all the fibers are reduced curves was studied by \\textit{B. Teissier} in the 1970's, see [RÃ©solution simultanÃ©e. I. II. Lect. Notes Math. 777, 71--146 (1980; Zbl 0464.14005)].\n\n(2) The author proves theorems comparing different possible notions of equisingularity for deformations of plane curve singularities, reduced everywhere except possibly at finitely many points, parametrized by \\(({\\mathbb C}^k,0)\\).

They can be constructed by gluing hyperbolic simplices by isometries along faces, so that the singular locus is contained in the 1-skeleton.

Local rigidity of three-dimensional cone-manifolds with (fixed) cone angles less than \(2\pi\) has been established by several authors, provided that the topology of the singular graph is preserved: namely the space of deformations is locally parameterized by the cone angles. Among others we cite \textit{C. D. Hodgson} and \textit{S. P. Kerckhoff} [J. Differ. Geom. 48, No. 1, 1--59 (1998; Zbl 0919.57009)], \textit{R. Mazzeo} and \textit{G. Montcouquiol} [ibid. 87, No. 3, 525--576 (2011; Zbl 1234.53014)], and \textit{H. Weiss} [ibid. 71, No. 3, 437--506 (2005; Zbl 1098.53038)].

When the cone angles are less than \(\pi\), the topology of the singular locus does not change under deformation. This paper however shows that when the angles are larger than \(\pi\), then there exist deformations such that the vertices of the singular locus of valency \(\geq 4\) can split along new singular edges. To describe such splittings one has to look at the link of a singular vertex (which is a sphere with cone points, one for each singular edge adjacent to the vertex). A splitting of the vertex is described in terms of curves in the link, so that the corresponding edges are split by this curve. The authors give sufficient conditions in terms of the geometry of this curve so that the splitting exists. Moreover they give precise parameters for the deformation space with this given topology, namely the cone angles of the old singular edges and the length of the new edges.

The result uses a cohomology theorem of Weiss, and the paper mainly deals with representation spaces. In particular, it relies on the results of \textit{W. M. Goldman} [in: Dani, S. G.

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem.

Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Summary: Completeness and other forms of Zorn's Lemma are sometimes invoked for semantic proofs of conservation in relatively elementary mathematical contexts in which the corresponding syntactical conservation would suffice.

In section 3 we give a formula for the characteristic pairs of the transform of \\(f\\) along the sequence of blow ups of points resolving the singularity.

We use an inversion formula of Abhyankar to obtain the results of this paper.","The Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem implies that every finite semigroup \(S\) divides an alternating wreath product of groups and finite aperiodic semigroups. The least number of group factors in such a wreath product is called the complexity of \(S\) and denoted \(Sc\). The problem of whether there is an algorithm computing the complexity function remains open for over the past thirty years and has motivated a considerable deal of research in finite semigroup theory. The conjecture that \(Sc\) is the maximum of all \((eSe)c\) where \(e\) ranges over the idempotents of \(S\) was proposed in the late 1960's, being verified in the completely regular case. \textit{J. Rhodes} [J. Algebra 49, 1-45 (1977; Zbl 0379.20054)] gave a counterexample with four non-zero \(\mathcal J\)-classes. To obtain it, he was guided by the Presentation Lemma, a technical result relating complexity of a semigroup \(S\) having a \([0]\)-minimal ideal \(I\) with a nontrivial group such that \(S\) acts faithfully both on the right and on the left of \(I\) (called a group-mapping semigroup) with the complexity of certain associated semigroups via a coordinatization of regular \(\mathcal J\)-classes and the action of \(S\) on them. In the present paper, the authors give a proof of the Presentation Lemma and a categorical formulation of the lemma. This leads to the verification of the above conjecture in several cases, where some technical definitions are left out: (1) when there is a unique maximal \(\mathcal J\)-class among the regular ones containing non- trivial groups; (2) for almost-disjoint semigroups; (3) for overlapping monoids; (4) for semigroups with at most three non-zero \(\mathcal J\)-classes.",0

The current article presents a number of impressive applications of this theory in dimensions 3 and 4.


The authors begin by defining a numerical invariant for a rational homology sphere together with a Spin\(^c\) structure, which they call a correction term. This invariant is an analog of that of \textit{K. A. Frøyshov} defined in [Math. Res. Lett. 3, 373-390 (1996; Zbl 0872.57024)]. This invariant is additive with respect to connected sums and is a rational homology cobordism invariant. The authors show that for an integral homology sphere \(Y\), this correction term represents the difference between the Casson invariant of the three-manifold and the Euler characteristic of \(HF^+_{red}(Y)\).


For an integral homology 3-sphere \(Y\), the authors define the \textit{complexity} of \(Y\) to be the rank of \(HF^+_{red}(Y)\). Previous results giving lower bounds for the complexity of a \(Y\) and for the manifold resulting from \(1/n\)-Dehn surgery on a knot in \(Y\) are improved.


An integral homology 3-sphere is said to be invisible if both the complexity and the correction term vanish; it is shown that for any knot \(K\) in an invisible homology sphere \(Y\), if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is nontrivial then any nontrivial surgery on the knot yields a 3-manifold which is not invisible. Some restrictions on knots in \(S^3\) with lens space surgeries are obtained. A table of allowed Alexander polynomials for knots in \(S^3\) with lens space surgeries is provided. Calculations are performed for the complexity, the correction term and/or \(HF^+\) for integral homology spheres resulting from surgeries on \((p,q)\)-torus knots, for certain Brieskorn spheres, for manifolds resulting from \(1/n\)-Dehn surgery on the figure eight knot in \(S^3\), for the three-torus, and for some surgies on certain pretzel knots. A new proof of Donaldson's diagonalizability theorem is provided. If \(X\) is a four-manifold with boundary an integral homology sphere \(Y\) and if \(\xi\) is a characteristic vector for the intersection form, it is shown that \(\xi^2 + \roman{rk}(H^2(X;\mathbb Z))\) is bounded above by 4 times the correction term of \(Y\). This leads to a new proof of the Thom conjecture for \({\mathbb C}P^2\), first proved by \textit{P. B. Kronheimer} and \textit{T. S. Mrowka} in [Math Res. Lett. 1, 797-808 (1994; Zbl 0851.57023)] and by \textit{J. W. Morgan, Z. Szabó} and \textit{C. H. Taubes} in [J. Differ. Geom. 44, 706-788 (1996; Zbl 0974.53063)]. The inequality also places constraints on the intersection forms of 4-manifolds which bound certain Seifert fibered spaces.",0

Verf. behandelt im Rahmen der Komplettierungstheorie nach den topologischen Ringen nun die nulldimensionalen topologischen Gruppen. Außer dem ``\(\mathfrak B _\nu \)-adischen'' Verfahren der Komplettierung abzählbarer Gruppen (in denen eine Folge absteigender Normalteiler \(\mathfrak B _\nu \) nebst ihren Nebengruppen zu Umgebungen ernannt worden sind) führt zu nulldimensionalen Gruppen auch das im wesentlichen mit ihm übereinstimmende ``\textit{Brouwer}sche'' Verfahren (Proc. Akad. Wet. Amsterdam 12 (1910), 785-794), das \textit{H. Freudenthal} zum ``\(G_n\)-adischen'' Verfahren ausgedehnt hat (Proc. Akad. Wet. Amsterdam 38 (1935), 414-418; JFM 61.0611.*-612; siehe auch: Entwicklungen von Räumen und ihren Gruppen, Compositio math., Groningen, 4 (1937), 145-234; F. d. M. 63) und die dort zitierte Literatur.

Zunächst beweist Verf. einige Sätze, die bereits in seiner Dissertation stehen (Amsterdam 1931; JFM 57.0716.*-717), und zeigt, daß sich jede \textit{Cantor}sche Gruppe \(\mathfrak B _\nu \)-adisch erzeugen läßt. Für die \textit{Cantor}schen Gruppen gilt ein Analogon des \textit{Jordan-Hölder}schen Satzes. Jede kompakte Gruppe topologischer Transformationen einer \textit{Cantor}schen Menge ist \textit{Cantor}sch; usw.

Bei einer kompakten \(\mathfrak B _\nu \)-adisch erzeugten Gruppe \(\mathfrak G\) wird das formale (evtl. unendliche) Produkt der Ordnungen der \(\mathfrak B _\nu /\mathfrak B _{\nu +1}\)(eine Invariante) die Ordnung genannt; sie ähnelt sehr der gewöhnlichen Ordnung endlicher Gruppen. Die universellen Zahlen (vgl. z. B. \textit{van Dantzig}, Nombres universels ou \(\nu \)-adiques avec une introduction sur l'algèbre topologique, Ann. sci. Ecole norm. sup. (3) 23 (1936), 275-307; F. d. M. 62\(_{\text{II}}\)) spielen für die kompakten \(\mathfrak B _\nu \)-adischen Gruppen dieselbe Rolle wie die ganzen Zahlen für die endlichen Gruppen; insbesondere kann man Potenzen von Gruppenelementen mit universellen Exponenten bilden. Die Ordnung der Gruppe läßt sich als Ideal im Ring \(J\) der universellen Zahlen deuten (Ordnungsideal). Primoid heißt die Grappe, wenn ihre Ordnung eine Primzahlpotenz ist. Charakteristik heißt der g. g. T. aller Ideale \(\mathfrak a\) aus \(J\) mit: \(x^\mathfrak a=1\) für alle \(x\in\mathfrak G\). Die Charakteristik ist ein Teiler der Ordnung. Jede abelsche \textit{Cantor}sche Gruppe ist direktes Produkt primoider.

Primoide Untergruppen, deren Index zu ihrer Ordnung teilerfremd ist, heißen \textit{Sylow}gruppen. Über \textit{Sylow}gruppen beweist Verf. allerlei Sätze, die teilweise wohl auch für den Fall endlicher Gruppen neu sind. Jede primoide Untergruppe ist in einer \textit{Sylow}untergruppe enthalten. Jede \textit{Cantor}sche Gruppe ist quasi-direktes Produkt ihrer \textit{Sylow}klassen (\textit{Sylow}klasse der Ordnung \(p^\alpha \) ist die Menge aller Elemente, deren Ordnung Teiler von \(p^\alpha \) ist; \(\mathfrak G\) ist quasi-direktes Produkt der Teilmengen \(M_r\), wenn jedes Element \(x\) in der Form \(x = x_1,x_2,\ldots \) geschrieben werden kann mit eindeutig bestimmten von \(x\) stetig abhängenden, untereinander vertauschbaren \(x_r\in M_r\) und jedes \(M_r\) ein invarianter Komplex ist, der die Eins und zu jedem Element das inverse enthält); usw.",0

In contrast to the general approach established by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [Int. J. Math. 6, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004); J. Algebr.

Here this is replaced by the single condition \\(H^0(D,\\operatorname {End}E\\otimes N_{D/S}^{-k})=0\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) and it is shown that the full moduli functor is represented even by a scheme. The proof does not need geometric invariant theory and is based on interpreting the moduli problem as a subfunctor of a Quot-functor over a relative Grassmannian. Since it involves the degeneration of a certain spectral sequence, it does not generalize immediately to higher dimensions.","Let \(<X:R>\) be a presentation of a group G, with \(G=F/N\), where F is a free group with basis X and N is the normal closure of R in F. For \(n\in {\mathbb{N}}\) let R(n) be the set of all words in X which are conjugate to some \(r\in R\) by some reduced word of length at most n. Let F(n) be the set of initial segments of words in R(n). On F(n) there is an equivalence relation \(\sim_ n\) where \(w_ 1w_ 2\sim_ nw_ 1w_ 0w_ 2\) whenever both are in F(n) and \(w_ 0\) is in R(n).


Let f be any function \(f: {\mathbb{N}}\to {\mathbb{N}}\). The presentation \(<X:R>\) is said to be f-decidable if given any element in F represented by a word w of length m then \(w\in N\) iff \(w\sim_ n1\) for \(n=f(m)\). The Todd- Coxeter algorithm shows that any presentation is f-decidable for some f. But in general f needs not to be recursive. The word problem for G is decidable iff G possesses a presentation such that this presentation is f-decidable for some recursive f.

The main result is the following\n\nTheorem. Let \\(X\\) be a smooth projective rationally connected variety \\(X\\) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic \\(0\\), let \\(U\\subset X\\) be an open subset, \nand let \\(x_0\\in U\\) be a point.

The authors' goal is to prove that if \\(k\\) is a finite field, then such an \\(X\\) contains ``many'' rational curves. More precisely, they prove that if the dimension of \\(X\\) is at least 3, \\(S\\subset X\\) is a zero-dimensional smooth subscheme, and the cardinality of \\(k\\) is bigger than some number depending on the dimension of \\(X\\) and the degrees of \\(X\\) and \\(S\\), then there exists a smooth rational curve \\(C_S\\subset X\\) containing \\(S\\). This result has some striking applications to the case when \\(k\\) is a number field (thus answering an old question of J.-L.~Colliot-ThÃ©lÃ¨ne): it implies that for almost all primes \\(v\\) of \\(k\\) the R-equivalence on \\(X(k_v)\\) is trivial and the group of classes of zero-cycles of degree zero of \\(X_v\\) equals zero. This has been known only for some special classes of varieties like rational surfaces or linear algebraic groups. (For some more recent development, see \\textit{J.~KollÃ¡r} [Publ. Res. Inst. Math.

The aim is to find a rational curve on \\(X\\) passing through a given \\(S\\). There are such curves defined over \\(\\bar k\\), hence the space \\(M\\subset \\text{Hilb}(X)\\) of smooth rational curves containing \\(S\\) is not empty. To prove that \\(M(k)\\) is not empty, the authors first find an irreducible subvariety \\(W\\subset M_{\\bar k}\\) which is Galois invariant. This is possible if \\(k\\) is an arbitrary perfect field: the proof uses a geometric method of ``combs'' developed by the first author and is the most technical part of the paper. To deduce the existence of a rational point on \\(M\\), the authors suggest two ways: either to use the fact that the ultraproduct of infinitely many finite fields whose orders go to infinity is a pseudo-algebraically closed field (and hence every geometrically irreducible variety has a dense set of rational points), or to produce a bound on the basic projective invariants of \\(W\\) and use the Lang--Weil theorem.",1

First, we derive the uniqueness and existence of mild solutions for functional differential equations by the approach of fixed-point methods and fractional resolvent under more general settings. Then, we present new sufficient conditions for approximate controllability of functional control system by means of the iterative and approximate methods. Our results unify and generalize some previous works on this topic.",0

 Let \(k\) be an algebraic closure of a finite field of odd characteristic. Let \(V\) be a \(k\)-vector space of dimension \(2n\). Let \(H\) be the symplectic group \(G^{\theta} \cong \mathrm{Sp}_{2n}\) where \(\theta\) is an involutive automorphism on \(G = \mathrm{GL}(V)\). The symmetric space \(G/H\) can be identified with \(G_{-}^{\theta} := \{g \in G : \theta(g)=g^{-1} \}\). Further, \(H\) acts diagonally on the variety \(\mathbb{X} := G_{-}^{\theta} \times V\).

In the first one, the set of character sheaves on \(\mathbb{X}\) is defined as a certain set of \(H\)-equivariant simple perverse sheaves on \(\mathbb{X}\). The authors consider the \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-structure on \(\mathbb{X}\) with Frobenius map \(F\). If \(\hat{\mathbb{X}}^F\) denotes the set of character sheaves \(A\) such that \(F^{\ast}A \cong A\), then in the second paper, the authors prove that if \(q\) is large enough, the set of characteristic functions of character sheaves in it forms a basis of the space of \(H^F\)-invariant functions on \(\mathbb{X}^F\). A more general definition of character sheaves modelled on a method of Ginzburg had been suggested by \textit{A. Henderson} and \textit{P. E. Trapa} [J. Algebra 370, 32--45 (2012; Zbl 1273.14093)].

One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S.

It was introduced by \\textit{J. Whitehead} [Ann. Math. (2) 47, 782--800 (1936; Zbl 0015.24804)], a famous topologist and group theorist who used it to solve an important algorithmic problem concerning automorphisms of a free group. Since then, this method was used to solve numerous problems in group theory, topology, combinatorics, and probably in some other areas as well. \n\nIn this paper, we give a survey of what seems to be the first applications of the peak reduction technique in commutative algebra and affine algebraic geometry. Using this technique, we have contributed toward a classification of two-variable polynomials having classified, up to an automorphism, polynomials of the form \\(ax^n+by^m+\\sum_{im+jn \\leq mn}c_{ij}x^iy^j\\) (i.e. polynomials whose Newton polygon is either a triangle or a line segment). This has several applications to the study of embeddings of algebraic curves in the plane. In particular, upon combining our method with a well-known theorem of \\textit{M. Zaidenberg} and \\textit{V. Lin} [Sov. Math. Dokl. 28, 200--204 (1983; Zbl 0564.14014)] we have shown that one can decide ``almost'' just by inspection whether or not a polynomial fiber \\(\\{p(x,y)=0\\}\\) is an irreducible simply connected curve in \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\). \n\nRecently, \\textit{P. Wightwick} [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 157, 341--367 (2001; Zbl 1019.14023)] used the idea of peak reduction in combination with splice diagrams technique due to D. Eisenbud and W. Neumann to classify all two-variable polynomials over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) up to an automorphism.

Verlinde proposed a stunning formula for the dimension of the space of conformal blocks within the Wess-Zumino-Witten model of conformal quantum field theory. Verlinde's formula involves certain rational trigonometric sums of highly complicated combinatorial structure, whose effective computation represents a real mathematical challenge. On the other hand, this formula turned out to have a close relationship to the geometry of the moduli spaces of flat connections over compact Riemann surfaces, and it was this spectacular, utmost striking discovery that opened the way to computing various intersection numbers in the enumerative geometry of such moduli spaces. The paper under review makes another step forward in this direction. Namely, in order to help to uncover the geometric information hidden in Verlinde's formula, the author derives a compact polynomial formula computing certain rational trigonometric sums occuring in this context. Building upon his earlier results on rational sums and Bernoulli polynomials corresponding to central hyperplane arrangements [\\textit{A. Szenes}, Int. Math. Res. Not. 1998, No. 18, 937-956 (1998; Zbl 0968.11015)], the author extends these investigations to affine hyperplane arrangements, obtains then a local formula for rational trigonomteric sums of ``Verlinde-type'', and compares his formula to a related result in the work of \\textit{J.-M. Bismut} and \\textit{F. Labourie} [Symplectic geometry and the Verlinde formulas, Surv. Differ. Geom., Suppl. J. Differ. Geom. 5, 97--311 (1999; Zbl 0997.53066)].

In some sense, the description of noncommutative projective curves that was begun in the earlier paper can thus be considered complete.\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a semiprime, Noetherian, connected graded \\(k\\)-algebra of quadratic growth.

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Anstatt die Unbekannten des Problemes durch Betrachtung der einwirkenden Kräfte zu bestimmen, führt der Verfasser für dieselben von ihm willkürlich ersonnene Ausdrücke ein.

1837308,"The author considers the moduli problem of representing pairs \\((\\mathcal E, \\phi)\\) where \\(\\mathcal E\\) is a torsion-free sheaf on a smooth connected complex projective surface \\(S\\) and \\(\\phi: {\\mathcal E_D}\\rightarrow E\\) is a framing with a vector bundle \\(E\\) on a smooth connected complete curve \\(D\\subset S\\). In contrast to the general approach established by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [Int. J. Math. 6, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004); J. Algebr.

Lehn's} doctoral thesis [Moduli spaces of framed vector bundles, Bonner Mathematische Schriften 241 (1993; Zbl 0841.14012)] where \\(\\phi\\) is required to be an isomorphism.

Here this is replaced by the single condition \\(H^0(D,\\operatorname {End}E\\otimes N_{D/S}^{-k})=0\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) and it is shown that the full moduli functor is represented even by a scheme. The proof does not need geometric invariant theory and is based on interpreting the moduli problem as a subfunctor of a Quot-functor over a relative Grassmannian. Since it involves the degeneration of a certain spectral sequence, it does not generalize immediately to higher dimensions.","Let \\((X, {\\mathcal O}_X(1))\\) be a nonsingular projective polarized surface over an algebraically closed field \\(k\\) of characteristic zero. Let also \\(D\\) be an effective divisor and \\(F_D\\) a locally free \\({\\mathcal O}_D\\)-module. The author introduces a notion of a \\((D, F_D)\\)-framed sheaf on \\(X\\) which generalizes analogous notion for vector bundles. Also, the notion of a framed Atiyah class of a flat family of framed sheaves and the Kodaira--Spencer map for framed sheaves are developed. The notion of a framed sheaf is a particular case of the notion of a framed module which was introduced by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [J. Algebr. Geom. 4, No. 1, 67--104 (1995; Zbl 0839.14023)], [Int. J. Math. 6, No. 2, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004)]. Applying the framed Atiyah class, the author proves the formula for the tangent space to the moduli space for \\((D, F_D)\\)-framed sheaves with Hilbert polynomial \\(P\\) on \\(X\\), at a smooth point. The formula proven is analogous to the formula for the tangent space to the moduli of Gieseker-stable torsion-free sheaves.\n\n Furthermore, the author defines a skew-symmetric bilinear form on the moduli space of framed sheaves and proves that it is closed and nondegenerate. In particular under some condition it defines a symplectic structure on the moduli space.\n\nAs an application, the symplectic structures on moduli spaces of \\((D, F_D)\\)-framed sheaves are constructed on some birationally ruled surfaces, as well as a generalization of \\textit{F.

Anal. Prilozh. 21, No. 2, 46--63 (1987; Zbl 0634.17010); ibid. 21, No. 4, 47--61 (1987; Zbl 0659.17012)]. This was extended by the reviewer to a finite number of possible position of poles [Lett.

The article gives results on their cohomology.


Let \(\Sigma_r\) be the open Riemann surface obtained from \(\Sigma\) by removing \(r\) points. Denote by \(\text{Hol}(\Sigma_r)\) the Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields on \(\Sigma_r\) with its standard Fréchet topology. The algebra \(\text{Mer}(\Sigma_r)\) of meromorphic vector fields on \(\Sigma\) which are holomorphic on \(\Sigma_r\) is a subalgebra. It is shown in the article, that it is a dense subalgebra (with respect to the Fréchet topology). Furthermore it is shown that on the level of continuous cohomology one has an isomorphism
\[
H^p_{\text{cont}}(\text{Hol}(\Sigma_r))\cong H^p_{\text{cont}} (\text{Mer}(\Sigma_r)).
\]
 The former cohomology is known by a result of \textit{N. Kawazumi} [Ann. Inst. Fourier 43, 655--712 (1993; Zbl 0782.57019)]. It can be given as a graded exterior algebra with even generators of degree 2 corresponding to the generators of \(H_1(\Sigma_r)\) and one odd generator of degree 3. In particular, the spaces of the continuous cohomology are all finite-dimensional and the second cohomology for the case of two points is \((2g+1)\)-dimensional. This shows the conjectures of Feigin and Novikov in the context of continuous cohomology.

From the text of the erratum: There is a mistake in the statement of the main lemma. It should read: Lemma 1. Let \(\Sigma_r=\Sigma\setminus\{p_1,\dots,p_r\}\) be an open Riemann surface of finite type.

Suppose that \(\Sigma_r\) is trivializable, i.e. that the algebraic tangent bundle of the corresponding affine curve is trivial. Then \(\overline {\text{Mer }(\Sigma_r)}=\text{Hol }(\Sigma_r)\), in other words, in the topology of uniform convergence on the compact sets \(K_n\), a function with essential singularities at the points \(p_k\) may be approximated by functions with poles at the points.",0

Then for any \(R\)-algebra \(A\) we have \(\text{Spf} A=\text{colim}_J\text{Spec} A/J\) where \(J\) runs over all open ideals of \(A\). Let \(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a\) and \(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m\) denote the formal group laws over \(R\) given by \(x+_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a}y =x+y\) and \(x+_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m} y = x+y+xy\) respectively, which are both isomorphic to \(\text{Spf} R[[x]]\) as formal schemes over \(R\). Consider the set \(C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a; \hat{\mathbb{G}}_m)\) of symmetric formal power series \(f\) in \(k\) variables over \(R\) satisfying the relation
\[
\begin{multlined} f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots )- _{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m} f(x_0+_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a}x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots ) \\ +_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m} f(x_0, x_1+_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a}x_2, x_3, \cdots ) -_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m} f(x_0, x_1, x_3, \cdots )=1_{\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m}. \end{multlined}

 Then it also becomes a group scheme, called the Lubin-Tate \(k\)-variant symmetric 2-cocycle group. In this paper the authors compute the coordinate ring of \(\text{Spec} \, \mathbb{Z}_{(2)}\times C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a; \hat{\mathbb{G}}_m)\) for \(k \geq 1\). The result is:
\[

The author begins with the theory of quantum spin chain, the search for an algebraic description of the Lax operators led to the first example of deformation of the universal enveloping algebra, \(U_q(\text{su}(2))\). In the next section the author explains the Yang-Baxter relation, firstly imposed by him and Takhtajan, as the condition for the unambiguity of the reduction of a monomial in possibly many ways. Then he recalls the role of Drinfeld, who introduced the notion of universal \(R\)-matrix and of course the name ``quantum group'' itself.

Geom. 29, 665-683 (1989; Zbl 0671.53045)] has constructed quiver varieties from extended Dynkin diagrams of types \\(\\widetilde A_n,\\widetilde D_n,\\widetilde E_n\\). These quiver varieties are important objects for the study of simple singularities. Let \\(p\\) be the quotient map of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group. The semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities are constructed on the quotient space of Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group of corresponding types. Then these quiver varieties are the pull-back of semiuniversal deformations of simple singularities by the quotient map \\(p\\). These quiver varieties are obtained as the symplectic quotients of symplectic vector spaces by a reductive group. So the coordinate rings are invariant subrings of polynomial rings with respect to the action of the group. In general it is difficult to find a minimal set of generators of an invariant ring and the relations between them.\n\n\nIn this paper the author shows that this is possible for the case of quiver varieties constructed by P. B. Kronheimer. Moreover surprisingly it can be shown that the obtained relation is unique and irreducible. In this research the invariant theory of quivers by \\textit{L. Le Bruyn} and \\textit{C. Procesi} [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 317, 585-598 (1990; Zbl 0693.16018)] and of matrices of low degrees by \\textit{K. Nakamoto} [J. Pure Appl.

Math. 6, 71-103 (1972; Zbl 0232.08001)], the set of C-representations of Q with dimension vector \\(\\alpha\\), R(Q,\\(\\alpha)\\), is an affine variety where the linear reductive group \\(GL(\\alpha)=\\prod_{i}GL_{\\alpha (i)}(C)\\) acts by isomorphisms of the category of representations. \n\n\nThe question which is considered here is to study the orbit structure of GL(\\(\\alpha)\\) acting on R(Q,\\(\\alpha)\\).

1591107,"From the introduction: Let \\(p,q:\\mathbb{C}^2\\to\\mathbb{C}\\) be two polynomials.

One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S. Abhyankar} and \\textit{T.-T. Moh}, J. Reine Angew. Math. 276, 148-166 (1975; Zbl 0332.14004) and \\textit{M. Suzuki}, J. Math. Soc. Japan 26, 241-257 (1974; Zbl 0276.14001)]. \\textit{V. Shpilrain} and \\textit{J.-T. Yu} have proved algorithms for the cases where one of the polynomials is \\(x\\) and the other a part of a basis for \\(\\mathbb{C}[x,y]\\) [J. Algebra 197, 546-558 (1997; Zbl 0899.13029)] and where both polynomials are of the form \\(Ax^r+By^s+ \\sum_{\\alpha s+\\beta r\\leq rs}b_{\\alpha \\beta} x^\\alpha y^\\beta\\) [J. Algebra, 217, 668-678 (1999; Zbl 0964.14025)].\n\n\nIn the paper under review, we prove a general algorithm. While the proof is done for polynomials over the complex numbers, the method applies to any algebraically closed field.","This paper deals with polynomials of the form \n\\[\np(x,y)=ax^n+by^m+\\sum_{im+jn \\leq mn}c_{ij}x^iy^j\n\\]\n \\(a,\\;b,\\;c_{ij} \\in K\\), a field of characteristic 0, and in case \\(K=\\mathbb{C}\\), the field of complex numbers, with their 0-loci in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\). The Newton polygon of these polynomials are triangles or line segments. In theorem 1.1 the authors give conditions on the coefficients so that two of these polynomials are not equivalent under automorphisms of \\(K[x,y]\\).\n\n\nIn this paper the problem of finding a canonical model of a given polynomial, is arranged by considering certain elementary transformations of \\(K[t] \\times K[t]\\) and by Whitehead's idea of \\textit{peak reduction}. An application, on polynomials whose 0-loci admit a one-variable parametrization, is discussed in proposition 1.2 and in theorem 1.3, where in particular, using a result of \\textit{V. Ya. Lin} and \\textit{M. G. Zaidenberg} [in: Voronezh Winter Math. Sch., Transl., Ser. 2, Am. Math. Soc. 184(37), 111-130 (1998; Zbl 0955.32013)], irreducible simply connected curves are related to certain polynomials of the above form.\n\n\nAnother application concerns the number of inequivalent embeddings of algebraic curves (with a place at infinity) in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\) (here equivalent means: under automorphisms of \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\)). By a result of \\textit{S. S. Abhyankar} and \\textit{B. Singh} [Am. J. Math. 100, 99-175 (1978; Zbl 0383.14007)]\\ an irreducible algebraic curve with a place at infinity cannot have infinitely many inequivalent embeddings in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\), while the first example of such a curve with at least two inequivalent embeddings in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\) is contained in a paper by \\textit{S.

The authors prove that for any \\(k \\geq 2\\) there is an irreducible algebraic curve (with a place at infinity), which has at least \\(k\\) inequivalent embeddings in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\), i.e. there are arbitrary (but finitely) many isomorphic algebraic curves in \\({\\mathbb{C}^2}\\), belonging to different orbits under the action of \\(\\Aut({\\mathbb{C}^2})\\).",1

The authors extend the least squares method to the case of dependent observations. They present the form of the adaptive estimator constructed by the least squares method for the case when the components of the noise vector are correlated. The correlation between observations sometimes leads to the absence of the consistent estimator of the parameters \(c_k\).

Name: text, dtype: object","This is substantial paper devoted to a systematic study of the algebraic structure of Dedekind cuts in ordered abelian groups. Let \(\check{G}\) be the collection of cuts of such a group \(G\). \(\check{G}\) has a naturally defined ordering and the unary minus operation, it also has two closely related additions \(+\) (left addition) and \(+^R\) (right addition). Each of the additions is definable from each other and the minus operation. Thus, \(\check{G}\) is an \(\mathcal L\)-structure with a signature \((\leq, {\mathbf 0}, +,-)\), where \({\mathbf 0}\) is a constant representing the cut \(((-\infty,0],(0,+\infty))\). An \(\mathcal L\)-structure \(M\) is called a pre-dom if \((M,\leq, {\mathbf 0},+,-)\) is an abelian monoid with neutral element \({\mathbf 0}\), and \(-:M\rightarrow M\) is an anti-automorphism of \(\leq\). For \(x,y\in M\): \(x-y:=-((-x)+y)\), \(\delta:=- {\mathbf 0}\), \(\widehat{x}:=x-x\), and \(|x|:=\max(x,-x)\). The element \(\widehat{x}\) is called the width of \(x\). The concept of width turns out to be of fundamental importance.

A pre-dom \(M\) is called a dom (double ordered monoid) if, in addition, \(M\) satisfies: \(\delta\geq {\mathbf 0}\), \(|x|\geq {\mathbf 0}\), and \(x\geq y\) iff \(x-y\geq {\mathbf 0}\). The main theorem says that the universal part of the first-order theory of cuts of ordered abelian groups is axiomatized by the axioms for doms together with the additional axiom \(- {\mathbf 0}< {\mathbf 0}\). It follows that each dom is a substructure of \(\check{G}\) or \(\widetilde{G}\), for some abelian ordered group \(G\), where \(\widetilde{G}\) is the disjoint union of \(G\) and \(\check{G}\) with the operations suitably extended.

Other sections of the paper contain various constructions on groups which are useful in the study of doms, results on independence of the dom axioms, and on alternative axiomatisations. The last section is devoted to a generalization of concepts of the valuation theory from ordered abelian groups to doms.

The paper concludes with a list of open problems concerning axiomatizability and decidability in doms.",0
1463607,"Let \\(X\\) be a smooth cubic hypersurface in \\(\\mathbb P^n\\). For a general line \\(l \\subset X\\), let \\(X_l\\) be the blow-up of \\(X\\) along \\(l\\).

The author considers here the case \\(n \\geq 6\\) and shows that \\(D_l\\) is always singular and the rational map \\(D_l \\to Q_l\\) is not a morphism.

By a generalized Prym construction for the primitive cohomologies (denoting by \\(H^0\\) the primitive part of each cohomology group \\(H\\)) the following results are achieved:\n\n Theorem 2.

The first one is a geometric proof of the general Hodge conjecture \\(GHC(X,n-1,1)\\): The full cohomology \\(H^{n-1}(X,\\mathbb Z)\\) is supported on the subvariety \\(Z\\) which is the union of all the lines in \\(X\\) incident to \\(l\\).\n\nThe second one, concerning the variety of lines contained in \\(X\\), shows a result originally due to \\textit{I. Shimada} [J. Fac. Sci. Univ. Tokyo Sect. IA Math. 37, 703--719 (1990; Zbl 0734.14011)]: The Abel-Jacobi map \\(H^{n-1}(X,\\mathbb Z)^0\\to H^{n-3}(F,\\mathbb Z)^0\\) is proved to be an isomorphism of Hodge structures.","A Hodge structure \\(V\\) of weight \\(k\\) acted on by a complex multiplication field \\(K\\) (CM field, abbreviated) defines, under certain conditions on the action of \\(K\\) on \\(V\\), a polarized Hodge structure \\(V_{1/2}\\) of weight \\(k-1\\) with the same underlying space. This so-called half-twist of \\(V\\) was introduced by \\textit{B. van Geemen} in a previous paper [J. Math. Soc. Japan 53, No. 4, 813--833 (2001; Zbl 1074.14509)], motivated by the fact that the Hodge conjectures seem to be closely linked to the geometry of varieties admitting Hodge structures with such a half-twist. Also, half-twists may be regarded as a certain partial generalization of the Kuga-Satake construction [\\textit{M. Kuga} and \\textit{I. Satake}, Math. Ann. 169, 239--242 (1967; Zbl 0221.14019)], which shows their early (implicit) appearance in this context.\n\n In the paper under review, the authors study some special classes of varieties carrying Hodge structures that allow a half-twist. In particular, they investigate hypersurfaces \\(Y_k\\) of degree \\(d\\geq 3\\) and dimension \\(k\\geq 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{P}^{k+1}\\), which are \\(d\\)-fold coverings of \\(\\mathbb{P}^k\\) that are totally branched along hypersurfaces \\(X_{k-1}\\) of degree \\(d\\) in \\(\\mathbb{P}^k\\) and they show under what conditions a suitable part of the cohomology of \\(Y_k\\) yields a natural half-twist. This leads to further, very concrete and well-behaved examples, among which the Fermat curve \\(Y_1\\) of degree \\(d\\) occurs, and to the Torelli-type question of to what extent the branch locus \\(K_{k-1}\\) is already determined by the constructed half-twist \\(V_{1/2}\\). This problem is partially solved in the course of the present paper, and important applications of the authors' results are given as well, mainly with respect to the classical Kuga-Satake correspondences. The main result, in this regard, generalizes a previous theorem by \\textit{C. Voisin} on the existence of certain Kuga-Satake correspondences [Lect. Notes Pure Appl. Math. 179, 265--285 (1996; Zbl 0912.14003)].\n\n Altogether, this work demonstrates that half-twists, if they exist, do bear plenty of geometric information and, therefore, must be seen as a significant tool in the Hodge theory of special algebraic varieties.",1

So far, although some achievements based on divided and conquer method in the rough set theory have been acquired, the systematic methods for knowledge reduction based on divide and conquer method are still absent. In this paper, the knowledge reduction approaches based on divide and conquer method, under equivalence relation and under tolerance relation, are presented, respectively. After that, a systematic approach, named as the abstract process for knowledge reduction based on divide and conquer method in rough set theory, is proposed. Based on the presented approach, two algorithms for knowledge reduction, including an algorithm for attribute reduction and an algorithm for attribute value reduction, are presented. Some experimental evaluations are done to test the methods on uci data sets and KDDCUP99 data sets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approaches are efficient to process large data sets with good recognition rate, compared with KNN, SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and CART.",0

The expressions \\(V^ G (k,g)\\) were first introduced by E. Verlinde in the context of conformal quantum field theory [cf. \\textit{E. Verlinde}, Nucl. Physics B, Field Theory and Statistical Systems 300, No. 3, 360-376 (1988)]. Their significance in algebraic geometry stems from the (originally conjectural) fact that they are related to the Hilbert functions of moduli spaces of semi-stable vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces of genus \\(g\\). The corresponding relation between those Hilbert functions of moduli spaces and the ``Verlinde numbers'' \\(V^ G (k,g)\\) used to be called the ``Verlinde conjecture'' for the respective moduli spaces, and its verification, mainly in the cases of \\(G= \\text{SU} (n)\\) and \\(G= \\text{SL} (n)\\), has been a central topic of research in the last five years. \n\n\nMore precisely, the Verlinde conjecture, in most general setting, can be roughly stated as follows. Let \\(C\\) be a compact Riemann surface of genus \\(g\\), and let \\({\\mathcal M}_ C^ G\\) be the (factually existing) moduli space of principal G-bundles over \\(C\\). Then there is an ample line bundle \\({\\mathcal L}\\) over \\({\\mathcal M}^ G_ C\\), a so-called generalized theta bundle, such that \\(\\dim_ \\mathbb{C} H^ 0 ({\\mathcal M}_ C^ G, {\\mathcal L}^{\\otimes k})= V^ G (k_ h, g)\\) for any \\(k\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), where \\(h\\) denotes the dual Coxeter number of the group \\(G\\). \n\n\nIn this form, and for \\(G= \\text{SL} (n)\\), the Verlinde conjecture has recently been verified by \\textit{G. Faltings} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 2, 347-374 (1994; Zbl 0809.14009)]; \\textit{A. Beauville} and \\textit{Y. Laszlo} [Commun. Math. Phys. 164, No. 2, 385-419 (1994; Zbl 0815.14015)]; \\textit{S.

After a brief overview of the structure of topological field theories, fusion algebras and Verlinde's formal calculus, the explicit behavior of \\(V^ G (k,g)\\) as a function of \\(k\\) is studied, again in the special case of \\(\\text{SL} (n)\\). The main result is a residue formula for \\(V^{\\text{SL} (n)} (k,g)\\) yielding the deep fact that these numbers are integer-valued polynomials in \\(k\\). The author then shows how this residue formula for \\(V^{\\text{SL} (n)} (k,g)\\) can be related, via the Grothendieck- Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, to Witten's conjectures on the intersection numbers of moduli spaces of curves [cf. \\textit{E.

Assuming the validity of Witten's formulas, a quick proof of the Verlinde conjecture (as stated above) is given. \n\n\nThis very instructive approach puts the Verlinde formulas into a wider context, and provides some more evidence of Witten's conjectures from this now well-established complex of results.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0810.00011].",1

In contrast to the general approach established by \\textit{D. Huybrechts} and \\textit{M. Lehn} [Int. J. Math. 6, 297--324 (1995; Zbl 0865.14004); J. Algebr.

Here this is replaced by the single condition \\(H^0(D,\\operatorname {End}E\\otimes N_{D/S}^{-k})=0\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) and it is shown that the full moduli functor is represented even by a scheme. The proof does not need geometric invariant theory and is based on interpreting the moduli problem as a subfunctor of a Quot-functor over a relative Grassmannian. Since it involves the degeneration of a certain spectral sequence, it does not generalize immediately to higher dimensions.","Equivariant geometry has been applied by several authors to obtain and classify explicit examples of hypersurfaces with a given condition and which are also invariant under the action of a given isometry group.

Ackermann, P. Bernays, T. Skolem). Vor dem Russellschen Stufenkalkül im Sinn der sogenannten vereinfachten Typentheorie haben diese mengentheorischen Logikkalküle zwei wesentliche Vorzüge voraus: (1) den Vorsprung einer bemerkenswerten formalisierungstechnischen Vereinfachung, (2) eine wesentliche und zugleich das inhaltliche mathematische Denken befriedigende Bereicherung der Ausdrucks- und der Beweismöglichkeiten.

Gleichzeitig ist es gelungen (vgl. \textit{W. V. Quine}, Amer. math. Monthly 44 (1937), 70-80; JFM 63.0022.*), auf eine Art, die den bis jetzt bekannten Prüfungsmethoden standgehalten hat, den Russell-Kalkül auf eine fast typenfreie Basis zu stellen. Durch diese Konstruktion wird der Stufenkalkül in bezug auf seine Ausdrucks- und Beweismöglichkeiten an den mengentheoretischen Logikkalkül herangerückt.

Diese Leistungen sind als wesentliche Fortschritte anzusehen. Aber auch sie sind nicht völlig befriedigend; denn auf eine evidente Art sind sie als Zweckschöpfungen charakterisiert. Von einem natürlichen Logikkalkül im Fregeschen Sinne, aber ohne die widersprucherzeugenden Zulassungen, durch die der Frege-Kalkül gesprengt worden ist, sind auch diese Kalküle noch wesentlich verschieden.

Ein natürlicher Logikkalkül wird typenfrei sein müssen wie der mengentheoretische Logikkalkül. Man wird jedoch von einem solchen Kalkül zugleich verlangen müssen, daß er die widersprucherzeugenden Protuberanzen nicht wie dieser durch axiomatische Diktate zum Verschwinden bringt, sondern durch Festsetzungen, die ganz unabhängig von dieser Zielsetzung für das inhaltliche Denken überzeugend sind.

Ein einleuchtender Ansatz von dieser Art ist das Prinzip, das besagt, daß ein \(k\)-stelliges Attribut im allgemeinen Falle nicht für alle Ding-\(k\)-tupel, die in einer präzisierten Sprache symbolisiert werden können, sinnvoll ist in dem Sinne, daß es auf ein beliebiges Ding-\(k\)-tupel entweder zutrifft oder \textit{nicht} zutrifft. Dieser Ansatz ist zuerst von \textit{H. Behmann} formuliert worden (Jber. Deutsche Math.-Verein. 40 (1931), 38-48; JFM 57.0056.*). Er ist zugleich mit der wichtigen Entdeckung publiziert worden, daß die übliche Konstruktion der Russellschen Antinomie auf der Verwendung von Kurzzeichen beruht, die nicht eliminierbar sind. Es ist einleuchtend, daß solche Kurzzeichen mindestens im allgemeinen Falle unzulässig sind.

Eine Kalkülschöpfung auf dieser Basis hat Behmann jedoch nicht vorgelegt. Dagegen hat \textit{A. Church} nach zwei typenfreien Systemen, die im Sinn dieser Richtlinien angelegt, aber gleichfalls durch widersprucherzeugende Konstruktionsmöglichkeiten gesprengt worden sind, ein drittes System dieser Art geschaffen, für welches die Widerspruchsfreiheit hat gezeigt werden können (Proc. nat. Acad. Sci. USA 21 (1935), 275-281; ``Mathematical logic'', autographiert (Princeton 1935/36); ``The calculi of lambda-conversion'' (Princeton 1941); JFM 61.0055.*; 62\(_{\text{II}}\), 1048 und die nachfolgende Besprechung).

Ein sehr bemerkenswerter Effekt dieses Systems ist eine Konstruktion, durch die es gelungen ist, den Ausdruck ``allgemeines Entscheidungsverfahren'' in einem inhaltlich einleuchtenden Sinne so zu präzisieren, daß A. Church auf Grund dieser Präzisierung die Unmöglichkeit eines solchen Verfahrens schon für den beschränkten Prädikatenkalkül der ersten Stufe hat beweisen können. Aber die Ausdrucks- und die Beweismöglichkeiten dieses Systems sind wesentlich beschränkter als die der mengentheoretischen Logikkalküle, und die auf dem Funktionsbegriff fußende Konstruktion dieses Kalküls entfernt sich so weit von den Ansätzen, die man für einen natürlichen Logikkalkül erwartet, daß auch dieses System den unerwünschten Zweckschöpfungen noch zu nahe steht.

Die vorliegende Arbeit ist der erste Entwurf eines typenfreien natürlichen Logikkalküls mit sehr weitreichenden Ausdrucks- und Beweismöglichkeiten. Sie will den Leser vor allem vertraut machen mit den Gedanken, die diesem Kalkül zugrunde liegen, und mit der Art, in der diese Gedanken eingegangen sind in die Konstituierung dieses Kalküls. In einem zweiten Teil soll die Widerspruchsfreiheit dieses Kalküls, in einem dritten soll die Leistungsfähigkeit desselben gezeigt werden.

Die Arbeit besteht aus vier Paragraphen: \S\ 1. Bemerkungen zur Behmannschen Arbeit, \S\ 2. Grundgedanken des Aufbaus, \S\ 3. Das Axiomensystem, \S\ 4. Herleitungen. Das Hauptproblem von \S\ 2 ist die Frage, welche Zeichenreihen als (sinnvolle) Ausdrücke gelten sollen. Es ergibt sich, daß die sinnvollen Ausdrücke nicht unabhängig von den beweisbaren Formeln oder kürzer: von den Sätzen bestimmt werden können, daß also die Ausdrucks- und Satzbestimmungen, die in den üblichen Konstruktionen getrennt marschieren, so miteinander zu verbinden sind, daß die Ausdrucksbestimmungen teilnehmen an dem im allgemeinen Falle indefiniten Charakter der Satzbestimmungen. Das einfachste Beispiel sind die Ausdrücke, die sich mit Hilfe der aussagenlogischen Verknüpfungen aus gewissen Primformeln erzeugen lassen. In diesem Falle beginnen die Ausdrucksbestimmungen mit der Festsetzung, daß jede beweisbare Formel ein Ausdruck ist. Dann erst folgen die üblichen Bestimmungen.

Die leitenden Gedanken sind in vier Leitsätzen formuliert: I (Präzisierung durch A 1, p. 18): Eine Zeichenreihe ohne freie Variablen ist ein \textit{Ausdruck} dann und, nur dann, wenn sie eine Aussage ist in dem Sinn, daß sie entweder wahr oder falsch ist. II (Präzisierung durch A 2, p. 18): Eine Zeichenreihe mit freien Variablen ist ein \textit{Prädikat} dann und nur dann, wenn sie durch wenigstens eine Einsetzung zu einer Aussage ergänzt werden kann. III (Präzisierung CI 15, p. 19): Zu jedem Ding (ich würde den Ausdruck ``Subjekt'' vorziehen) gibt es ein Prädikat, das mit ihm zusammen eine Aussage erzeugt. IV (Präzisierung CII 2. 3, p. 19): Kurzzeichen dürfen im allgemeinen Falle nur dann eingeführt werden, wenn sie eliminierbar sind.

Ein paar Druckfehler, auf die ich gestoßen bin, sind unerwünscht, aber nicht fatal.",0

This kind of vector bundles are interested because of many reasons. For instance, they are related to the existence of embeddings of the projective space in Grassmann variaties. It is well-known that a g.g. vector bundle \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) on \\(\\mathbb{P}^n\\) should have non-negative Chern classes: \\(c_i(\\mathcal{E})\\geq 0\\) for \\(i=0,\\dots n\\).\n\nThis paper gives a complete classification of g.g vector bundles \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) on \\(\\mathbb{P}^2\\) for \\(1\\leq c_1(\\mathcal{E})\\leq 5\\) and on \\(\\mathbb{P}^n\\), \\(n\\geq 3\\), for \\(1\\leq c_1(\\mathcal{E})\\leq 4\\).

Gelfand pairs of real or \(p\)-adic groups are similarly defined. If \({\mathbf G}\) is a reductive group defined over a finite field or a local field \(F\) and \({\mathbf H}\) an algebraic subgroup then \({\mathbf h}\) is called spherical [cf. \textit{D. Luna} and \textit{T. Vust}, Comment. Math. Helv. 58, 186--245 (1983; Zbl 0545.14010)] if there exists a Borel subgroup \({\mathbf B}\) such that \({\mathbf B}{\mathbf H}\) is open in \({\mathbf G}\). If \({\mathbf H}\) is a spherical subgroup then the groups of rational points, \(G= {\mathbf G}(F)\) and \(H={\mathbf H}(F)\), are expected to form a Gelfand pair or almost a Gelfand pair. Here ``almost'' is not a precise term, but taken to mean that ``most'' representations occur with multiplicity one or with small multiplicity in \(\text{Ind}^G_H1\).


In the paper under review, the authors study the spherical pair \((\text{GL}(n),O(n))\), where \(O(n)\) is an orthogonal group associated to a symmetric form for the case, where \(F\) is a finite field or a \(p\)-adic field. They also study the related spherical pair \((\text{GL}(n),\text{GO}(n))\), where \(\text{GO}(n)\) is the similitude group. In the case, where \(F= {\mathbb R}\) and \(O(n)\) is the standard compact group, then \((\text{GL}(n,{\mathbb R}),O(n,{\mathbb R}))\) is a Gelfand pair [cf. \textit{I. G. Macdonald}, Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials, 2nd ed. Oxford (1995; Zbl 0824.05059)]. However, when \(F\) is a finite field or a \(p\)-adic field this is no longer true. The authors study the multiplicities of cuspidal representations in \(\text{Ind}^G_H1\) for the finite field case and of ``level zero'' supercuspidal representations for the \(p\)-adic field case. Level zero supercuspidals are those supercuspidals which are obtained from cuspidal representations on the finite group via induction from a compact open mod center subgroup. In the finite field case, this multiplicity is the same as the dimension of the space of \(H\) fixed vectors in a supercuspidal representation.


In the finite field case, the authors use a formula of \textit{G. Lusztig} [The Grothendieck Festschrift, Vol. III, Prog. Math. 88, 57--81 (1990; Zbl 0773.20012)] to give a simple criterion for a cuspidal representation of \(\text{GL}(n)\) to have an \(O(n)\) fixed vector. They show that the dimension of the space of \(O(n)\) fixed vectors in this case is at most one (giving credence to the assumption that \((\text{GL}(n),O(n))\) is ``almost'' a Gelfand pair).


In the \(p\)-adic field case, the authors use a delicate analysis of a level zero supercuspidal representation and their result from the finite field case in order to give a precise formula for the multiplicity in question. They derive from their formula that for \(H= O(n)\) the multiplicity is at most two and that multiplicity two can occur, while for \(H= \text{GO}(n)\), the similitude group, the multiplicity is at most one. The results in this paper are used by the authors [Pac. J. Math. 185, No. 1, 149--162 (1998; Zbl 0921.22014)] in their study of supercuspidal representations of \(\text{GL}(n)\) which are distinguished by a unitary group.",0

1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group.

The author defines for \(s>r>1\), \(\varphi, \eta\) real numbers satisfying \(0\leq \varphi <2\pi\), \(0<\eta <\pi\) the annuli, \(D(r,s)= \{z=\rho e^{i\theta} \in\mathbb{C}: r<\rho <s\}\), and an annular rectangle, \(D(r,s, \varphi,\eta) =\{z= \rho e^{i \theta} \in\mathbb{C}: r<\rho<s, |\theta- \varphi |< \eta\}\).


Three theorems are then proven under the assumption that the exponents of convergence for the zero-sequences of the linearly independent solutions, \(f_1f_2\) satisfy \(\lambda (f_1) \lambda(f_2) =\infty\). It is then proven that the zero-sequences for \(E=f_1 f_2\) are uniformly distributed in the sense that quite large areas of the complex plane can be removed so that outside of these areas the contained zeros when counted for its exponents of convergence still remain infinite which regard to their maximums. A typical theorem proven is as follows:


Theorem 1. Given \(s>1\), let \((R_m)\) be a sequence of \(r\)-values such that \(R_{m+1} >sR_n\), and let \((\varphi_m)\) be a sequence of real numbers such that \(0\leq\varphi_m<2\pi\). Moreover, fix \(\eta\) and \(K\) so that \(0<\eta <\pi\) and \(1<K<s\), and consider

D:= \bigcup^\infty_{m=1} D(R_m, KR_m, \varphi_m, \eta).

 Let now \(A(z)\) be transcendental entire of finite order \(\rho (A)\), and let \(f_1, f_2\) be two linearly independent solutions of our differential equation such that for \(E:= f_1f_2\), \(\lambda(E) =\infty\). Then \(\lambda_{\mathbb{C} \setminus D} (E)= \infty\).

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","As a succinct first summary essentially the authors own words may be the best ones: ``An elementary recursive bound on the degrees for Hilbert's 17th problem is given.

Stengle}, Math. Ann. 207, 87--97 (1973; Zbl 0253.14001)] states that given a system of sign conditions \\(\\mathcal F,\\) its unrealizability in any ordered extension of \\(K\\) and its incompatibility are equivalent. Right on the first pages the authors show by very short proofs how the real Nullstellensatz can be deduced and from this in turn Stengle's improved version of Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. \\textit{H. Lombardi} [Lect. Notes Math. 1524, 323--345 (1992; Zbl 0782.14001)] has given complexity bounds for the Positivstellensatz which involve towers of powers of 2 whose length increase linearly with \\(k.\\) From this similar enormous bounds follow for the other two theorems. With the tools of weak inference and weak existence designed by Lombardi at the time and by replacing Cohen-Hoermander quantifier elimination by a new type of quantifier elimination based on Thom encoding of real algebraic numbers; see [\\textit{D. Perrucci} and \\textit{M.-F. Roy}, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 168, No. 8, 1588--1604 (2017; Zbl 1373.14060)], the authors achieve very notable improvements getting down from primitive recursive bounds to elementary recursive bounds. \\par Chapter 2 is dedicated to obtain many weak inference rules continuously used in later chapters. Assume \\(\\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{F}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{F}_m, \\mathcal{H}\\) are systems of sign conditions and we know that if \\(\\mathcal F\\) is satisfied at \\(\\vartheta\\in R^k\\), then one of \\(\\mathcal{F}_1, \\dots ,\\mathcal F_m\\) is satisfied at \\(\\vartheta\\). Then if the enlarged signconditions \\([\\mathcal F_1,\\mathcal H], \\dots, [\\mathcal F_m,\\mathcal H]\\) are unsatisfiable, then \\([\\mathcal F,\\mathcal H]\\) will be unsatisfiable. (Here, naturally \\([\\mathcal F,\\mathcal H]= \\{\\mathcal{F}_{\\neq}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{\\neq} , \\mathcal{F}_{\\geq}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{\\geq} , \\mathcal{F}_{=}\\cup \\mathcal{H}_{=} \\}\\). ) A weak inference is a construction to reflect this on the incompatibility level: it produces from initial incompatibilities \\(\\downarrow \\mathcal F_1,\\mathcal H\\downarrow, \\downarrow \\mathcal F_2,\\mathcal H\\downarrow ,\\dots , \\downarrow \\mathcal F_m,\\mathcal H\\downarrow \\) a final incompatibility \\( \\downarrow \\mathcal F ,\\mathcal H\\downarrow. \\) Theorems proving such constructions are generically written \\( \\mathcal{F} \\vdash \\bigvee\\limits _{j=1}^m \\mathcal{F}_j,\\) making aptly use of well-known symbols of Logic. The authors accompany such theorems almost always with degree bounds. To give a flavour of such results we cite (using with the authors a notational abuse) \\par Lemma 2.17: Let \\(P\\in K[u]=K[u_1,\\dots,u_n].\\) Then \\(P\\neq 0 \\vdash P>0 \\vee P<0.\\) If we have incompatibilities in \\(K[v]\\) where \\(v \\supset u\\) with monoid part \\(S_1 \\cdot P^{2e_1}\\) and \\(S_2 \\cdot P^{2e_2}\\) and degree in \\(w\\subset v\\) bounded in \\(\\delta_{w,1}\\) and \\(\\delta_{w,2},\\) the final incompatibility has monoid part \\(S_1\\cdot S_2\\cdot P^{2(e_1+e_2)}\\) and degree in \\(w\\) bounded by \\(\\delta_{w,1}+ \\delta_{w,2}.\\) \\par Here and in similar theorems the superset of the original variable set creeps in via the auxiliary sign conditions \\(\\mathcal{H}.\\) Section 2 contains also a generalization of weak inference, called weak existence. An application of the principle of weak existence is the intermediate value theorem in chapter 3 which reads now as if \\(P= \\sum_{0\\leq h\\leq p} C_h y^h \\in K[u][y],\\) then \\( \\exists(t_1,t_2) [C_p \\neq 0, P(t_1)P(t_2)\\leq 0] \\vdash \\exists [P(t)=0].\\) Here already the degree estimates for the final incompatibility are doubly exponential in \\(p\\) (the degree of \\(P\\) with respect to \\(y\\)). The proof is based on the fact that if a field is real its extension by an irreducible polynomial of odd degree is also real, an idea \\textit{E. Artin} [Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hamb. 5, 100--115 (1926; JFM 52.0122.01)] used in his famous solution to Hilbert' s 17th problem. The theorem is used to prove the weak existence of the real root for a monic polynomial of odd degree (again with doubly exponential bounds). Chapter 4 uses this theorem to give a weak existence form of the fundamental theorem of algebra for a polynomial \\(p\\) based on Laplace's proof by induction on the largest nonnegative integer \\(r\\) such that \\(2^r|\\deg p.\\) The chapter continues with sections on the decomposition of polynomials into irreducible factors also with multiplicities. Hermite created a theory in which a quadratic form (hence a matrix Her\\((P,Q)\\) -- in fact a Hankel matrix) is associated to two one-variable real polynomials \\(P,Q\\) and which allows to express the number of roots in \\(\\mathbb C\\) of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is nonzero as the rank of the matrix Her\\((P,Q);\\) and the difference of the number of real roots of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is positive minus the number of roots of \\(P\\) where \\(Q\\) is negative as the signature of Her\\((P,Q).\\) This theorem and its formulation in terms of weak inference and attendant degree estimates are the object of the long chapter 5. Along the way Sylvester's law of inertia is treated and a link of Hermite's theory to subresultants is given. Chapter 6 is titled `Elimination of one variable' . In Section 6.1 it is noted that given a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(p\\) in \\(K[y],\\) the signs of the first \\(p-1\\) derivatives of \\(P\\) at a real root \\(\\theta\\) of \\(P\\) define a sequence which is unique to it. This is called Thom encoding of \\(\\theta\\) with respect to \\(P.\\) It gives rise to a new elimination method for families \\(\\mathcal Q\\) of univariate polynomials which depend on parameters. \\(\\text{Elim}(\\mathcal Q)\\) is a family of polynomials which determines the realizable sign conditions of \\(\\mathcal Q.\\) A classic method for this is Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition -- see e.g. [\\textit{B. F. Caviness} (ed.) and \\textit{J. R. Johnson} (ed.), Quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic decomposition. Proceedings of a symposium, Linz, Austria, October 6--8, 1993. Wien: Springer (1998; Zbl 0906.03033)] -- but this is because its close connection to topology (semi-algebraic connectivity) not suitable for getting algebraic identities for showing incompatibilities. The chapter relies heavily on chapter 2 of course but uses only the two culminating results from chapters 4 and 5 respectively. Finally chapter 7 proves the two main results with which the paper opened: it establishes elementary recursive bounds as well for the Positivstellensatz as for the solution to Hilbert's 17th problem. Only the main result of chapter 6 is used. The annex, chapter 8, gives a number estimates for the multiple exponentials used earlier. \\par Although the paper is quite technical and the statements of the theorems because of the constructive nature and/or the complexity estimates longer than usual, the exposition which uses in later chapters only the culminating results of earlier ones will help to grasp more rapidly the main thread of reasoning. The paper resumes certainly decades of work and presents a breakthrough in its area.",1

Murai and Terai proved that if \(K[\Delta]\) satisfies Serre's condition (\(S_r\)), then (1) \((h_0,h_1,\dots, h_r)\) is an \(M\)-vector and (2) \(h_r+h_{r+1}+\cdots+h_d\geq 0\).

Theorem. If \(K[\Delta]\) satisfies Serre's condition (\(S_r\)), then (1) \((h_0,h_1,\dots, h_r)\) is an \(M\)-vector and (2) \({i\choose i}h_r+{i+1\choose i}h_{r+1}+\cdots+{i+d-r\choose i}h_d\geq 0\) for any \(i\) with \(0\leq i\leq r\).

1448638,"In a previous article [Invent. Math. 122, No. 2, 231-276 (1995; Zbl 0849.16022)], the authors have classified Noetherian graded domains of quadratic growth over algebraically closed fields; the paper under review extends this classification to semiprime algebras over an arbitrary base field \\(k\\). In some sense, the description of noncommutative projective curves that was begun in the earlier paper can thus be considered complete.\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a semiprime, Noetherian, connected graded \\(k\\)-algebra of quadratic growth. The description of \\(R\\) in terms of geometric data proceeds, roughly speaking, along the following lines: Let \\(Y\\) be a projective variety of dimension \\(\\leq 1\\) over the base field \\(k\\) and let \\(\\mathcal E\\) be an \\({\\mathcal O}_Y\\)-order in a finite dimensional semisimple algebra \\(A\\) over the field \\(K=k(Y)\\). Also, let \\(\\tau\\) be an automorphism of \\(A\\) that restricts to an automorphism \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(Y\\), and let \\(\\mathcal B\\) be an ample, invertible \\(\\mathcal E\\)-module. Following \\textit{M.~Van den Bergh} [J. Algebra 184, No. 2, 435-490 (1996; Zbl 0876.17011)], a Noetherian ``twisted homogeneous coordinate ring'' can be constructed as \\(B=\\bigoplus_n H^0(Y,{\\mathcal B}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes{\\mathcal B}^{\\tau^{n-1}})\\). The ring \\(R\\) is then Noetherian if and only if some Veronese subring \\(R^{(m)}\\) of \\(R\\) has the form \\(k+I\\), where \\(I\\) is a left ideal of such a ring \\(B\\) and where \\(I=B\\) at each point \\(p\\in Y\\) at which \\(\\sigma\\) has finite order. A lot of detailed information concerning semiprime graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2 is obtained from this characterization. For example, a finitely generated, semiprime graded Goldie ring \\(S\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S)=2\\) is non-Noetherian if and only if there exists a second layer link from a prime ideal \\(P\\) with \\(\\text{GKdim}(S/P)=1\\) to a maximal ideal \\(M\\) of \\(S\\).","The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension GK(--) is an extremely useful tool for the study of algebras over a field \\(k\\), since information about the growth of a \\(k\\)-algebra \\(A\\) often has far-reaching consequences for its structure. Thus, for example, if \\(A\\) is a domain (i.e. a ring without zero divisors) with \\(\\text{GK}(A)<\\infty\\), then \\(A\\) is left and right Ore. Or, by an important result of \\textit{L. Small} and \\textit{R. B. Warfield} jun. [J. Algebra 91, 386-389 (1984; Zbl 0545.16011)], if \\(A\\) is affine and prime with \\(\\text{GK}(A)=1\\), then \\(A\\) is finite as a module over its center which turns out to be a finitely generated domain of dimension 1. Furthermore, if in this case \\(A\\) is a domain and \\(k\\) is algebraically closed, then \\(A\\) is commutative. Since no \\(k\\)-algebra can have Gelfand-Kirillov dimension strictly between 1 and 2, it is natural to investigate domains \\(A\\) with \\(\\text{GK}(A)=2\\). In full generality this still seems to be intractable, so the authors restrict themselves to graded domains of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two and provide a fairly complete classification of these. Let \\(A=\\bigoplus_{n\\geq 0}A_n\\) be a finitely graded domain (i.e. \\(A\\) is finitely generated and \\(A_0\\) is a finite dimensional vector space over \\(k\\)) with \\(2\\leq\\text{GK}(A)\\leq{11\\over 5}\\). Then the nonzero homogeneous elements of \\(A\\) form an Ore set, yielding the so-called graded quotient ring of \\(A\\), which is known to be a skew Laurent polynomial ring \\(D[z,z^{-1};\\sigma]\\), where \\(D\\) is a division algebra, \\(z\\) is a homogeneous element of positive degree and \\(\\sigma\\) is an automorphism of \\(D\\).\n\n\nThe first major result of the paper under review is that \\(D\\) is finitely generated as a module over it center \\(K\\), and that \\(K\\) is a finitely generated field extension of \\(k\\) of transcendence degree one. It turns out that \\(\\text{GK}(A)=2\\), which is proved by establishing \\(\\text{GK}(D)=1\\) and then invoking the result of Small and Warfield mentioned above. That \\(11\\over 5\\) appears in the above inequality is due to the technical limitations of the proof that \\(\\text{GK}(D)=1\\), which is based on an intricate analysis of the relationship between the Hilbert series of \\(A\\) and the Ore condition. Since this number seems to have no obvious intrinsic significance, the authors conjecture that a graded domain cannot have Gelfand-Kirillov dimension strictly between 2 and 3. Assuming \\(k\\) to be algebraically closed yields \\(D=K\\), and it follows from algebraic geometry that \\(K\\) is the function field of a smooth projective curve, motivating a description of \\(A\\) in terms of geometric data. It is proved that if \\(A\\) is finitely generated by elements of degree 1 then, up to a finite dimensional vector space, \\(A\\) is isomorphic to the twisted homogeneous coordinate ring of an invertible sheaf over a projective curve. In this case, \\(A\\) is always noetherian. Furthermore, if the order of the automorphism \\(\\sigma\\) is infinite then \\(A\\) is primitive, and if \\(\\sigma\\) has finite order then \\(A\\) is finitely generated as a module over its center. If \\(A\\) is not generated in degree one, then it is still noetherian and primitive when \\(\\sigma\\) has infinite order, and a satisfactory description of the structure of \\(A\\) in geometric terms is obtained for this case as well. However, if the order of \\(\\sigma\\) is finite, then \\(A\\) is less well-behaved. Although a PI-ring, it need not be noetherian.",1

One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S.

Cassels proved that if Q has a non-trivial integral zero, then it has one satisfying \(| {\mathfrak x}| \ll | Q|^{(n-1)/2}.\) Here \(| {\mathfrak x}|\) and \(| Q|\) are the maximum modulus of the coordinates (respectively coefficients) of \({\mathfrak x}\) and Q, and the \(\ll\) constants will always depend only on n. Kneser showed that Cassel's result is best possible.


In earlier papers the authors showed that if Q is non-singular and vanishes on a d-dimensional rational subspace for some \(n\geq 2d>0\), then Q has a non-trivial integral zero satisfying \(| {\mathfrak x}| \ll | Q|^{(n-d)/2d}.\) The first theorem in this paper constructs quadratic forms which show that this higher dimensional analogue of Cassel's theorem is best possible.


Next, the authors consider the question of finding n linearly independent integral zeros of Q. Earlier they proved that if Q is non-singular and vanishes on a d-dimensional rational subspace with \(n\geq 2d>0\), then there are n linearly independent integral zeros \({\mathfrak x}_ 1,...,{\mathfrak x}_ n\) of Q satisfying

In particular, for an elliptic curve \\(E\\) over a totally real field \\(K\\), these results imply that \\(E\\) is modular, provided its residual Galois representation \\(\\bar \\rho = \\bar \\rho_{E,p}\\) is modular and \\(\\bar \\rho \\mid_{G_K(\\zeta_p)}\\) is absolutely irreducible (\\(p \\not= 2\\)).\n\nUsing a 3-5 and 3-7 switching argument, it is shown that \\(E\\) is modular unless \\({\\bar \\rho}_{E,p} \\mid G_{K(\\zeta_p)}\\) are simultaneously absolutely reducible for \\(p = 3, 5, 7\\). Such an elliptic curve \\(E\\) gives rise to a \\(K\\)-rational point on one of 27 modular curves, denoted by \\(X(u,v,w)\\), where \\(u \\in \\left\\{b3,s3,ns3 \\right\\}, v \\in \\left\\{ b5,s5,ns5 \\right\\}, w \\in \\left\\{ b7, s7, ns7 \\right\\}\\). The symbols \\(b, s, ns\\) refer to Borel, normalizer of split Cartan, normalizer of non-split Cartan level structures on \\(E\\) of the indicated level. We remark that the 3-7 switching argument is essential and its proof is nontrivial.\n\nA more refined analysis shows that in fact \\(E\\) gives rise to a \\(K\\)-rational point on one of seven modular curves \n\\[\nX(b5,b7), X(b3,s5), X(s3,s5),\n\\]\n and \n\\[\nX(b3,b5,d7), X(s3,b5,d7), X(b3,b5,e7), X(s3,b5,e7),\n\\]\n where \\(e\\) and \\(d\\) refer to a certain cover of the modular curves with normalizer of split Cartan and non-split Cartan level structures, respectively.\n\nFor \\(X\\) being one of the first group of modular curves above, the real quadratic points on the first group of modular curves are determined to be defined over \\(\\mathbb Q\\), have CM or are \\(\\mathbb Q\\)-curves, and hence are modular. This is accomplished by embedding the symmetric square \\(X^{(2)}\\) of \\(X\\) into the jacobian \\(J\\) of \\(X\\) and determining \\(J(\\mathbb Q)\\).\n\nFor \\(X\\) being one of the second group of modular curves, \\(X\\) is viewed as (the normalization of) the fibered product \\(X_1 \\times_{X(1)} X_2\\) using the \\(j\\)-map to \\(X(1)\\), where \n\\[\nX_1 = X(b3,b5), X(s3,b5) \\text{ and } X_2 = X(d7), X(e7).\n\\]\n Using the natural map \\(X^{(2)} \\rightarrow J_1 \\times J_2\\) and a novel Mordell-Weil sieve that applies in this situation, it is shown that the real quadratic points on \\(X\\) are non-existent or have \\(j\\)-invariant in \\(\\mathbb Q\\) (so are modular).\n\nModularity results for elliptic curves \\(E\\) over a general totally real field are also given, with some additional restrictions.",1

Less known is the differential Galois theory for differential equations (DEs) initiated by Piccard and Vessiot. This theory provides a framework for the solvability of the differential Galois group corresponding to a given DE and the integrability of the equation. Differential Galois theory for linear DEs have proved successful. However, there have been few attempts for nonlinear DEs.

This paper endeavors to fill this void. Here, an attempt is made on a second-order polynomial autonomous system in the complex domain. The authors establish the relation between the conformal relativistic differential Galois group and the subgroup of Möbius transformations. It is proved that the system under study is integrable in the Liouvillian sense if its conformal relativistic differential Galois group is solvable with derived length of at most two. It would be of interest to look at differential Galois theory for second-order DEs that are linearizable via a change of variables.",0

1754762,"It is well known that singularities of a normal toric variety can be resolved by a regular decomposition of its fan. In this paper the authors consider an affine toric variety \\(Z^\\Gamma\\) non necessarily normal embedded in an affine normal toric variety \\(Z_{\\rho}\\). Then they give a method to resolve the singularities of \\(Z_{\\rho}\\), this process will also resolve the singularities of \\(Z^{ \\Gamma }\\).","A toric variety is an algebraic variety over a field \\(k\\) containing an algebraic torus \\(T_X\\) whose natural action on itself extends to an action of \\(T_X\\) on \\(X\\). A morphism of toric varieties is equivariant if it is compatible with the action of the respective tori. In this paper, the authors give a constructive procedure to resolve the singularities of a toric embedded variety, in an equivariant way. More precisely, given a closed equivariant embedding \\(X \\subset M\\) of toric varieties, with \\(M\\) smooth, and both defined over a perfect field \\(k\\), they show how to chose subvarieties \\(D_0,\\dots, D_t\\), where \\(D_0\\) is a smooth subvariety of \\(M_0=M\\), \\(D_1\\) a smooth subvariety of \\(M_1\\), the blowing-up of \\(M_0\\) with center \\(D_0\\), and so on (thus we obtain a sequence of smooth varieties \\(M_0, \\ldots, M_{t+1}\\), and blowing-up morphisms \\(\\pi _i:M_{i+1} \\to M_i, i=0, \\dots, t\\)) such that, letting \\(X_0 =X\\) and \\(X_{i+1} \\subset M_{i+1}\\) be the strict transform of \\(X_i \\subset M_i\\) via \\(\\pi _i\\), we have: \n\n(a) \\(M_i\\) and \\(X_i\\) are toric, \\(D_i \\subset M_i\\) is \\(T_{M_i}\\)-invariant and the inclusion \\(X_i \\subset M_i\\) is equivariant, \n\n(b) if \\(C_i = X_i \\cap D_i\\), then \\(C_i\\) is \\(T_{X_i}\\)-invariant, \\(X_i\\) is normally flat along \\(C_i\\), and \\(C_i \\subset {\\text{Sing}}(X_i)\\) (provided \\(X_i\\) is not smooth), \n\n(c) \\(X_{t+1}\\) is smooth and it has normal crossings with the exceptional divisors that appear. \n\nA slight variation of the procedure allows one to get ``canonical equivariant embedded resolution'', i.e., the resolution procedure corresponding to an equivariant embedding \\(X \\subset M\\) of toric varieties as above induces that for \\(X'\\subset M'\\), if \\(g:M' \\to M\\) is an open equivariant embedding and \\(X'=g^{-1}(X)\\) (not counting isomorphisms in the sequences of blowing-ups). \n\nToric varieties are locally defined by ``binomial equations'' of the form \\({x_1^{\\alpha _1} \\ldots x_n^{\\alpha _n}} - {x_1^{\\beta _1} \\ldots x_n^{\\beta _n}}\\) (where \\(\\min(\\alpha _i, \\beta _i)=0\\), for all \\(i\\)). More generally, one may consider varieties locally defined by binomial equations as above, if they satisfy some mild additional conditions they are called binomial varieties (but some people use the expression in a slightly different sense). The authors show that their results on desingularization of embedded toric varieties extend, with minor changes, to embedded binomial varieties as well as to generalizations thereof: embedded toroidal and locally binomial varieties. The techniques involved in the main results are essentially similar to those used by the authors (and other mathematicians) in the theory of algorithmic, or canonical, resolution of singularities (specially, those of the authors' paper [Invent. Math. 128, 207--302 (1997; Zbl 0896.14006)] and \\textit{J. Wlodarczyk} [J. Am. Math. Soc. 18, 779--822 (2005; Zbl 1084.14018)]). For instance, the main results are obtained from a seemingly more technical result, namely a theorem on the resolution of marked monomial ideals. These are 5-tuples \\({\\mathcal H} = (M,N,P,H,e)\\), where \\(P \\subset N \\subset M\\) are smooth, toric varieties, \\(H\\) is a sum of sheaves of \\({\\mathcal O}_M\\)-ideals, each one locally a product of suitable principal ideals, and \\(e\\) is a positive integer, satisfying certain conditions. The singular set of such a marked ideal is the set of points of \\(P\\) at which the order of \\(H\\) is \\( \\geq e\\). But toric varieties (and their mentioned generalizations) have a strong combinatorial flavor. This is cleverly used by the authors to simplify and improve the presentation. For instance, in a crucial inductive step in the resolution process for marked ideals, one has to use (locally defined) maximal contact subvarieties. In general, these are available in characteristic zero only. But in the toric situation these can be obtained rather easily in any characteristic. (Still one needs the field to be perfect to obtain certain relevant isomorphisms of completions of rings). The authors include some interesting examples and propose some problems. For instance, to generalize the present results to the case of binomial varieties in the sense of \\textit{D. Eisenbud} and \\textit{B. Sturmfelds} [Duke Math.

In this context, Montesinos asked in relation to Fox's question: ``Given a knot \(k\) in \(S^3\) is the 3-sphere a covering of \(S^3\) branched over \(k\)?''. In this paper the author answers Montesinos's question in the affirmative for torus knots and a certain class of satellites of torus knots which includes all iterated torus knots. The main results:


Theorem 2.1. Let \(\tau_{p,q}\) be the \((p,q)\)-torus knot. Then, for every \(m\in\mathbb{N}\), there is an \(mpq\)-fold covering \(f_1:L(m,1) \to(S^3, \tau_{p,q})\) branched along \(\tau_{p, q}\) such that \(S_{f_1}\) is a fiber and \(f_1|S_{f_1}: S_{f_1}\to \tau_{p, q}\) is a homeomorphism.


(Here \(\tau_{p,q}\) is a regular fiber of the Seifert bundle \(S^3=(0,0; r/p,s/q)\), where \(-r/p-s/q =\pm 1/pq\); \(L(m,1)\) is the lens space considered as the Seifert bundle \((0,0; \pm m/1)\) and \(S_{f_1}\) denotes the singular set of \(f_1)\).


Corollary 2.2. Let \(\tau_{p,q}\) be the \((p,q)\)-torus knot in \(S^3\). Then, for any \(m\in\mathbb{N}\), there is an \(m^2pq\)-fold covering \(f:S^3 \to(S^3, \tau_{p,q})\) branched along \(\tau_{p,q}\). Moreover, \(S_f\) is a trivial knot and \(f|S_f:S_f \to\tau_{p,q}\) is an \(m\)-fold covering.


Theorem 2.3. Let \(f:M^3\to S^3\) be a covering branched along the knot \(k\) such that \(S_f\) is connnected and \(f|S_f\) is \(m\) to 1. Let \(J(k)\) be a monotone satellite of \(k\) whose winding number \(d\) divides \(m\). Then there is a covering \(g:M^3\to S^3\) branched over \(J(k)\) which coincides with \(f\) outside a tubular neighborhood of \(S_f\).


Corollary 2.4. The 3-sphere is an \(m^2pq\)-fold cover of \(S^3\) branched over \(J(\tau_{p,q})\), where \(\tau_{p,q}\) is the \((p,q)\)-torus knot, and the winding number of \(J(\tau_{p,q})\) is a divisor \(d\) of \(m\).

The set \\(C(\\mathbb{Z})\\) is infinite if and only if one of the following two conditions is satisfied: (a) \\(C_\\infty\\) consists of one point and \\(C(\\mathbb{Z})\\) contains at least one non-singular point. (b) \\(C_\\infty\\) consists of two points which are conjugate over a real quadratic field and \\(C({\\mathbf Z})\\) contains at least one non-singular point. \n\n\nThe part ``only if'' of Theorem A, in the case \\(n=2\\), is a direct consequence of [\\textit{A.

If \\((x,y)\\) is an integer solution of the above equation, then \\(x+1\\mid y\\) and so \\(y=(x+1)z\\), where \\(z\\) is an integer. It follows that \\(z^{2}- x^{2}=15\\), which clearly has finitely many solutions. We deduce that \\((X,Y)=(1,\\pm 8),(-1,0),(7,\\pm 64),(-7,\\pm 48)\\). Hence part (a) of Theorem A is not correct. \n\n\n(2) Let \\(C\\) be the rational curve defined by \\(f(X,Y)=\\) \\((X^{2}-2Y^{2})^{2}+XY = 0\\). Then \\(C_{\\infty}=\\{(\\sqrt{2}\\colon 1\\colon 0),(-\\sqrt{2}\\colon 1\\colon 0)\\}\\) and the couple \\((1,-1)\\) is a non-singular point on \\(C\\). By Theorem A it follows that \\(C(\\mathbb{Z})\\) is infinite. Let \\(x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z}-\\{0\\}\\) with \\(f(x,y)= 0\\). Set \\(d=\\text{gcd}(x,y)\\). Then \\(x=dx', y= dy'\\), where \\(x',y'\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\text{gcd}(x',y')=1\\). Thus \\((d({x'}^{2}-2{y'}^{2}))^{2}= |x'y'|\\), whence \\(|x'|=u^{2}\\), \\(|y'|=v^{2}\\) with \\(u,v\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(u>0, v>0\\). It follows that \\(d(u^{4}-2v^{4})=uv\\) and since \\(\\text{gcd}(u^{4}-2v^{4},uv)\\mid 2\\), we get \\(u^{4}-2v^{4}\\mid 2\\). The integer solutions of the equations \\(u^{4}-2v^{4} =\\pm 1,2\\) are well known [cf. \\textit{L. J . Mordell}. Diophantine equations, Academic Press, Lond.

Therefore, part (b) of Theorem A is also not correct. \n\n\nNote that it is possible for a curve \\(C\\) to satisfy (a) or (b) but at the same time to have more than two discrete valuation rings at infinity (as in the case of the second example), and so Siegel's finiteness theorem implies that \\(C(\\mathbb{Z})\\) is finite. \n\n\nThe reviewer believes that the statement of Theorem A can be corrected if we replace the set \\(C_{\\infty}\\) by \\(\\Sigma_{\\infty}\\) and make all necessary changes in the proof.",1

By a generalized Prym construction for the primitive cohomologies (denoting by \\(H^0\\) the primitive part of each cohomology group \\(H\\)) the following results are achieved:\n\n Theorem 2. Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be two elements of \\(H^{n-3}(S_l',\\mathbb Z)^0\\). Then \\(\\psi'(a) \\cdot \\psi'(b)=a \\cdot i_l^*b-a \\cdot b\\).\n\n Theorem 3. The Abel-Jacobi map \\({\\psi'}^0:H^{n-3}(S_l',\\mathbb Z)^0 \\to H^{n-1}(X,\\mathbb Z)^0\\) is surjective with kernel equal to the image of \\(H^{n-3}(Q_l',\\mathbb Z)^0\\) in \\(H^{n-3}(S_l',\\mathbb Z)^0\\).\n\nTwo interesting applications are given. The first one is a geometric proof of the general Hodge conjecture \\(GHC(X,n-1,1)\\): The full cohomology \\(H^{n-1}(X,\\mathbb Z)\\) is supported on the subvariety \\(Z\\) which is the union of all the lines in \\(X\\) incident to \\(l\\).\n\nThe second one, concerning the variety of lines contained in \\(X\\), shows a result originally due to \\textit{I.

1700879,"Toric varieties often provide an excellent class of examples in the study of complicated questions in algebraic geometry. On the one hand, due to their correspondence to fans, many questions can be reduced to completely combinatorial properties, on the other hand, they represent an ample cross-section of all varieties.

Their motivation comes from the Singer Conjecture: If \(M^n\) is a closed aspherical manifold, then \(\mathcal H_i(\widetilde M^n) = 0\) for all \(i \not=n/2\).

 A construction \textit{M. Davis} [Ann. Math. (2), 117, 293--324 (1983; Zbl 0531.57041)] associates to any finite flag complex \(L\) a right-angled Coxeter group \(W_L\) and a contractible cubical cell complex \(\Sigma_L\) on which \(W_L\) acts properly and cocompactly. If \(L\) is homeomorphic to the \((n-1)\)-sphere, then \(\Sigma_L\) is an \(n\)-manifold. If \(\Gamma\) is a torsion-free subgroup of finite index in \(W_L\) (such subgroups always exist), then \(\Gamma\) acts freely on \(\Sigma_L\) and \(\Sigma_L/\Gamma\) is an aspherical finite complex. Therefore the Singer Conjecture for such manifolds is natural. Conjecture: Suppose \(L\) is a triangulation of the \((n-1)\)-sphere as a flag complex. Then \(\mathcal H_i(\Sigma_L)=0\) for all \(i\not=n/2\).

 In their previous paper [Geom. Topol., 5, 7--74 (2001; Zbl 1118.58300)], the authors proved that the Conjecture holds true for \(n\leq 4\).

The main result of this paper is to assert the vanishing of the reduced \(\ell^2\)-homology above middle dimensions for barycentric subdivisions of cellulations of manifolds. As a corollary, the authors obtain that the conjecture holds true for the barycentric subdivision of a PL-cellulation of the \((n-1)\)-sphere for all even \(n \leq 8\).",0

The result obtained is effective, in that it gives an effectively computable bound for the implied constant in the conjecture. The author uses known results to reduce the problem to the calculation of \\textit{admissible constants} for graphs arising from the bad fibres of the curve, and most of the work in this article goes into computing these admissible constants.\n\nIn Section~1, the author recalls various definitions from graph theory, including admissible constants. It is then shown how to apply this to the graphs of components arising from a semistable fibration of curves. Section~2 is devoted to so-called hyperelliptic graphs, which are certain graphs equipped with an involution, and in Section~3 the author calculates the admissible constants for hyperelliptic graphs, culminating in an explicit formula given in Theorem~3.14.

This interesting paper deals with the property of the operator \(C_\varphi\) to be nontrivially essentially normal. (An operator \(T\) on a Hilbert space is said to be essentially normal if the commutator \(TT^\ast - T^\ast T\) is compact, and nontrivially essentially normal if it is essentially normal, but neither normal nor compact).


It was known that a composition operator on \(H^2\) is normal if and only it is generated by a dilatation \(\varphi(z)=az\) with \(|a|\leq 1\) [cf. \textit{H. J. Schwartz}, ``Composition Operators on \(H^p\)'' (Thesis, University of Toledo) (1969)]. Recently it was shown that among the conformal automorphisms of \(\mathbb{U}\) the rotations are the only ones that induce essentially normal composition operators on \(H^2\). In this paper, the authors characterize the nontrivially essentially normal composition operators in the following Theorem. A composition operator \(C_\varphi\) induced on \(H^2\) by a linear-fractional map \(\varphi\) is nontrivially essentially normal if and only if \(\varphi\) is a parabolic nonautomorphism.",0

The local heights are well-defined if the intersection of supports is empty. In the archimedean case, the metrics are hermitian and the local heights are defined by a refined version of the *-product of Gillet-SoulÃ© developed on compact varieties without assuming regularity. In the non-archimedean case, the local heights are intersection numbers using methods from rigid and formal geometry to handle non-discrete valuations. To include canonical metrics of line bundles algebraically equivalent to 0, a locai Chow cohomology is introduced on formal models over the valuation ring. Using Tate's limit argument, canonical local heights of subvarieties on an abelian variety are obtained with respect to any pseudo-divisors. By integration over an \\(M\\)-field we deduce corresponding results for global heights of subvarieties.",1

The present paper works out the same proof in the language of schemes. The main tool is Grothendieck's base change theorem.

In an appendix it is shown that the functor of relative Cartier divisors of the curve is representable.","Let \(K\) be an arbitrary field. Let \(A\) be an algebra over \(K\). If \(G\) is a multiplicative group with neutral element \(e\), then a \(G\)-grading on \(A\) is a decomposition \(A=\bigoplus_{g\in G}A_g\) as a direct sum of \(K\)-subspaces such that \(A_gA_h\subseteq A_{gh}\) for any \(g,h\in G\). The support \(\text{supp}(A)\) of the grading consists of all those \(g\in G\) such that \(A_g\neq 0\). The grading is called faithful if \(\text{supp}(A)\) generates the group \(G\). Any grading can be reduced to a faithful grading if we restrict it to the subgroup generated by the support. The grading is called ergodic if \(\dim(A_e)=1\).

 Group gradings on certain matrix algebras have been considered during recent years. Gradings on full matrix algebras and on upper triangular matrix algebra have been studied. \textit{J. Bichon} [in Asian-Eur. J. Math. 1, No. 1, 1-13 (2008; Zbl 1170.16028)] proved that there exists a Hopf algebra coaction on the diagonal algebra \(K^n\) which is universal in a large class of Hopf algebras. Moreover, for an algebraically closed \(K\) of characteristic zero, coactions of group algebras on \(K^n\) which are just group gradings on the diagonal algebra \(K^n\) are described.

 In the paper under review, all group gradings on the diagonal \(K^n\) are described, where \(K\) is an arbitrary field. The approach is ring theoretical and Hopf algebra techniques are not used. Ergodic gradings are classified and the structure of faithful gradings is completely described.",0

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Das siebzehnte Problem in \\textit{Hilberts} Pariser Vortrag (Nachrichten GÃ¶ttingen 1900, 253-297, insbesondere 284; F. d.

Ist schlieÃŸlich \\(K\\) reell, \\(\\varOmega\\) eine algebraisch abgeschlossene algebraische Erweiterung von \\(K\\) und \\(\\alpha\\) ein Element aus \\(K\\), das in \\(K\\) nicht Quadratsumme ist, so gibt es -- wie man unter Benutzung einer Wohlordnung der Elemente von \\(\\varOmega\\) erkennt -- einen ZwischenkÃ¶rper \\(P\\) zwischen \\(K\\) und \\(\\varOmega\\) von der Eigenschaft, daÃŸ \\(\\alpha\\) nicht in \\(P\\), aber in jeder echten algebraischen Erweiterung von \\(P\\) Quadratsumme ist. Aus der Definition von \\(P\\) folgt dann: \\(P\\) ist reell, \\(-\\alpha\\) ist Quadrat in \\(P\\), also in jeder echten algebraischen Erweiterung von \\(P\\) ist \\(-1=\\dfrac{\\alpha}{-\\alpha}\\) Quadratsumme, d. h. \\(P\\) ist reell abgeschlossen.

Also ist nach Satz 1 jede definite rationale Funktion mit Koeffizienten aus \\(R\\) Quadratsumme rationaler Funktionen mit Koeffizienten aus \\(R\\) (Satz 4). -- Nennt man eine rationale Funktion mit Koeffizienten aus einem \\textit{beliebigen} algebraischen ZahlkÃ¶rper \\(R\\) \\textit{total} \\textit{definit}, wenn, sie fÃ¼r rationale Werte der VerÃ¤nderlichen (falls sie sinnvoll ist) nur total positive Werte aus \\(R\\) annimmt, so gilt entsprechend: Jede total definite Funktion mit Koeffizienten aus \\(R\\) ist Quadratsumme rationaler Funktionen mit Koeffizienten aus \\(R\\) (Satz 5).

For a large class of rings \(A\), which includes all commutative, von Neumann regular and stable range 1 rings, together with all Banach algebras, it is known that, when \(n \geq 3\), the subgroups of \(\mathrm{GL}_ nA\) normalized by \(E_ nA\) (the subgroup generated by the elementary matrices) can be completely classified in terms of the (two-sided) \(A\)-ideals. For anything like such a classification to extend to the case \(n = 2\) further restrictions usually have to be imposed on \(A\). (Any classification of this type appears to fail, for example, when \(A = \mathbb Z\).)


Menal (in collaboration with the second author) has classified the \(E_ 2A\)-normalized subgroups of \(\mathrm{GL}_ 2A\) when (i) \(A\) is a von Neumann regular ring, (ii) \(A\) is a Banach algebra or a stable range 1 ring containing \(1/2\), and (iii) \(A\) is a local ring, where \(A/\text{rad }A\) has at least 4 elements. In case (i) the classification involves the \(A\)-ideals. For (ii), (iii) the classification involves the quasi-ideals of \(A\). The principal way in which these results improve on the (many) previously known special cases is that in nearly all of the latter the ring is assumed to be commutative.",0

1591107,"From the introduction: Let \\(p,q:\\mathbb{C}^2\\to\\mathbb{C}\\) be two polynomials. Then \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are equivalent if there exists \\(f\\in\\Aut \\mathbb{C} [x,y]\\), the group of all \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)-algebra automorphisms of \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\), such that \\(p\\circ f=q\\). One of the interesting and open questions about polynomials in two variables over \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\) is to find an algorithm to decide whether or not two polynomials are equivalent. A number of algorithms have been developed for special cases. For example the Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki embedding theorem was proved by the development of such an algorithm [\\textit{S. S. Abhyankar} and \\textit{T.-T. Moh}, J. Reine Angew. Math. 276, 148-166 (1975; Zbl 0332.14004) and \\textit{M. Suzuki}, J. Math. Soc. Japan 26, 241-257 (1974; Zbl 0276.14001)]. \\textit{V. Shpilrain} and \\textit{J.-T. Yu} have proved algorithms for the cases where one of the polynomials is \\(x\\) and the other a part of a basis for \\(\\mathbb{C}[x,y]\\) [J. Algebra 197, 546-558 (1997; Zbl 0899.13029)] and where both polynomials are of the form \\(Ax^r+By^s+ \\sum_{\\alpha s+\\beta r\\leq rs}b_{\\alpha \\beta} x^\\alpha y^\\beta\\) [J. Algebra, 217, 668-678 (1999; Zbl 0964.14025)].\n\n\nIn the paper under review, we prove a general algorithm. While the proof is done for polynomials over the complex numbers, the method applies to any algebraically closed field.","Since Katok found examples of Finsler structures on \(S^2\) with only \(2\) distinct closed geodesics in 1973, the classical problem of counting geometrically distinct closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds gained a new frontier; namely, that of considering the same problem on Finsler manifolds. Several interesting results regarding this problem were achieved in the past decades, and the paper under review contributes to the existing literature. Namely, the two main results of the paper regard existence of closed geodesics on Finsler spheres, under the assumptions that the Finsler structure is generic (all prime closed geodesics are assumed to be non-degenerate) and that the flag curvature and reversibility of the Finsler structure satisfy a certain inequality. The techniques used are inspired by earlier work of Long and Rademacher, studying the Morse theory of closed geodesics as critical points of the energy functional. Another interesting reference in this context that is omitted in the paper is the work of \textit{F. Mercuri} [Math. Z. 156, 231-245 (1977; Zbl 0355.58002); Math. Z. 156, 231--245 (1977; Zbl 0344.58013); Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei, VIII. Ser., Rend., Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Nat. 60, 111--118 (1976; Zbl 0362.53052)].",0

Gruber} and \textit{A. U. Klimyk} [J. Math. Phys. 25, 755-764 (1984; Zbl 0548.17005)]), but their methods work only for very simple Lie algebras. This new algorithm constructs explicit \textit{principal matrices} and avoids difficulties with commutators. The adjoint group [\textit{C. Chevalley}, Theory of Lie groups. I. Princeton Mathematical Series, Vol.~8. Princeton University Press. (1946; Zbl 0063.00842)] comes for free.


Denote by \(\{\xi_1,\xi_2,\dots,\xi_d\}\) a basis for the given Lie algebra. A basis for its universal enveloping algebra is then
\[
[[n]]\overset\text{def} = \xi^{n_1}_1\xi^{n_2}_2\cdots \xi^{n_d}_d,
\]
 where \(n\equiv (n_1,\dots, n_d)\). Group elements in a neighbourhood of the identity can be expressed as
\[
g(\alpha)\overset\text{def}= e^{\sum_\mu\alpha_\mu\xi_\mu}=g(A)\overset\text{def}= e^{A_1\xi_1}e^{A_2\xi_2}\dots e^{A_d\xi_d}.
\]
 The \(\alpha_i\), \(A_i\) are called respectively \textit{coordinates of the first and second kind.} The \textit{dual representations} are vector fields in terms of the coordinates of the second kind acting on the left or right, i.e. they define the left \textit{principal matrix} \(\pi^{\ddagger}(A)\) by
\[
\xi_jg(A)=\sum_\mu\pi^\ddagger_{j\mu}(A)\partial_\mu g(A)
\]
 leading to the dual representation
\[
\xi^\ddagger_j \overset\text{def}= \sum_\mu\pi^\ddagger_{j\mu}(A)\partial_\mu.
\]
 If \(A\) depends on a parameter \(s\) then, for any function \(f(A)\), there is a flow \(\dot f =\sum_\mu\dot A_\mu\partial_\mu f\) where \(\dot{\;}\equiv d/ds\). Letting \(X = \sum_{\mu}\alpha_\mu\xi_\mu\) leads to
\[
\dot g = Xg =\sum_{\mu}\alpha_\mu\xi^\ddagger_\mu g=\sum_{\lambda\mu}\alpha_\lambda \pi^\ddagger_{\lambda\mu} \partial_\mu g
\]
 and similarly in terms of \(\pi^*\), \(\xi^*\) with \(X\) acting on the right.


Matrix elements are defined by group elements \(g(A,\xi)\) acting on the basis \([[n]]\).


Using the \(\pi\)-matrices, the adjoint group, which is the exponential of the adjoint representation, is readily computed as follows. Denote the transposes by \(\widehat\pi= (\pi^\ddagger)^t\), \(\widehat\pi^*=(\pi^*)^t\) and let \(\check\pi(A)\) denote the adjoint group \(g(A,\check\xi)\), which is \(g\) with each basis element \(\xi_i\) replaced by the corresponding matrix of the adjoint representation \(\check\xi_i\). Then the main theorem, proved in \textit{P. Feinsilver} and \textit{R. Schott} [Algebraic structures and operator calculus, Vol. 3: Representations of Lie groups. Kluwer Academic Publishers. (1996; Zbl 0885.22014)] is that the adjoint group \(q(A,\check\xi)\) satisfies \(\widehat\pi^* =\widehat{\pi}g(A,\check\xi)\), i.e. \(\check\pi=\widehat\pi^{-1}\widehat{\pi}^*\).


The transposes \(\widehat{\pi}\), \(\widehat{\pi}^*\) are used in defining double duals in which the derivatives \(\partial_i\) are replaced by variables \(y_i\) and the variables \(A_i\) are replaced by derivatives \(\partial_i=\partial/\partial y_i\), thus
\[
\widehat\xi_j\overset\text{def}=\sum_\mu y_\mu\widehat\pi_{\mu j}(\partial),
\]
 where \(\partial = (\partial_1,\dots,\partial_d)\) and similarly for \(\xi^*\), \(\pi^*\).


The goal is to compute the matrices \(\pi^\ddagger\), \(\pi^*\). The direct approach using commutation relations is generally quite difficult, whereas the following algorithm avoids these difficulties and the use of the adjoint action.


1. Given a basis \(\{\xi_i\}\) form \(X = \sum_i\alpha_i\xi_i\) (or given \(X\) compute \(\{\xi_i\}\) as \(\{\partial X/\partial\alpha_i\})\).


2. Compute \(g\) as the product \(e^{A_1\xi_1}e^{A_2\xi_2}\dots e^{A_d\xi_d}\).


3. Compute \(Xg\) by matrix multiplication.


4. Write \(\dot g\) formally and equate it to \(Xg\).


5. Solve for \(\dot A_i\) and form the row vector \(\dot A\).


6. Find \(\pi^\ddagger\) from \(\dot A = \alpha\pi^\ddagger\) with \(\alpha\) the row vector \((\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_d)\).


7. Repeat steps 3-6 with \(gX\) to find \(\pi^*\).


8. Form the vector fields \(\xi^\ddagger=\pi^\ddagger\partial\), \(\xi^* =\pi^*\partial\) using column vectors.


9. Form double duals \(\widehat\xi\), \(\widehat\xi^*\) using \(\widehat\pi=(\pi^\ddagger)^t\), \(\widehat{\pi}^*=(\pi^*)^t\).


10. Compute the adjoint group \(\check \pi=\widehat\pi^{-1}\widehat\pi^*\).


A detailed example is given for E2, the Euclidean group in two dimensions, and the left-dual is given for E3. This approach involves much smaller matrices than does the direct approach. A complete and straightforward implementation in Maple is given.",0

The problem arise here is how to select an appropriate portfolio from a set of candidate projects. A good combination of projects can extensively promote the organisations in their competitive performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to present a practical model in addition to some solution approaches to choose the best and proper project portfolios with the considerations of projects' interactions, quantitative and qualitative criteria, and practical constraints. A linear formulation has been proposed which considers the interaction effects and integrates the number of selected projects, the segmentations, and the budgetary constraints into a single set of constraints. In order to solve the proposed model, a genetic algorithm and also a differential evolution algorithm are presented. Moreover, the efficiencies of these two algorithms are compared with an exact method using various numerical examples. Finally, through a case study the performance of the model is demonstrated.",0

Second (\\S7--\\S9), he introduces the general theory of linear algebraic groups and arithmetic subgroups which are used later. Third (\\S10--\\S16), he constructs fundamental domains of the reductive groups relative to arithmetic subgroups and deduces main properties of them corresponding to the theorems of Minkowski, Siegel and Hermite which are discussed in the previous parts. Comparing with the examples and proofs of the Iwasawa decompositions, Bruhat decompositions and the construction of Siegel domains in the classical groups, given in the first and second parts, the reader can clearly see in the third part how the classical theory has been generalized to the general algebraic groups. He who is familiar with the theory of algebraic groups and who wishes to know the theory rapidly can read directly the third part with \\S1. \n\nLet \\(G\\) be an algebraic group in \\(\\mathrm{GL}(V)\\) defined over \\(\\mathbb Q\\), \\(V\\) being a vector space over \\(\\mathbb C\\) of dimension \\(n\\).

A subgroup \\(\\Gamma\\) of \\(G_{\\mathbb Q}\\) is called an arithmetic subgroup if there exists a lattice of \\(V_{\\mathbb Q}\\) such that \\(\\Gamma\\) is commensurable to \\(G_L\\). A subset \\(\\Omega\\) of \\(G_R\\) is called fundamental for \\(\\Gamma\\), if it satisfies: (F\\(_0\\)) \\(K\\cdot \\Omega = \\Omega\\) for a maximal compact subgroup \\(K\\) of \\(G_R\\), (F\\(_1\\)) \\(\\Omega\\cdot\\Gamma = G_R\\), and (F\\(_2\\)) (Siegel's property) for any element \\(b\\) of \\(G_{\\mathbb Q}\\), the set of elements \\(\\gamma\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\Omega b\\cap\\Omega\\cdot\\gamma\\ne\\emptyset\\) if finite.

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Given a commutative ring \(R\), the Brauer group \(\mathrm{Br}(R)\) of \(R\) is the group of Morita equivalence classes of Azumaya \(R\)-algebras, with multiplication defined by the tensor product over \(R\) and inverse by taking the opposite algebra. This notion plays an important role in representation theory, and in algebraic geometry where Grothendieck introduced the more general notion of Brauer group \(\mathrm{Br}(X)\) of a scheme \(X\) and cohomological Brauer group \(\mathrm{Br}'(X)=H^2_{\mathrm{\'et}}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)_{tors}\) (the torsion subgroup of the second étale cohomology group of \(X\) with coefficients the multiplicative group \(\mathbb{G}_m\)). A critical problem was then to compare the Brauer group, abstract and not easily computable, to the cohomological Brauer group. They are not the same in general (there is only an inclusion \(\mathrm{Br}(X)\subset \mathrm{Br}'(X)\)) but coincide under additional assumptions on \(X\) (a result due to Gabber). Azumaya algebras naturally arise also in algebraic geometry when studying moduli spaces of vector bundles (e.g. as endomorphism algebras of twisted vector bundles).

The notions of Azumaya algebra and Brauer group were generalized further in stable homotopy theory and derived algebraic geometry. In [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 216, No. 11, 2361--2376 (2012; Zbl 1345.55003)], \textit{A. Baker} et al. defined Azumaya algebras and Brauer groups of commutative \(S\)-algebras (where \(S\) is the sphere spectrum) in order to study Galois theoretic properties of structured ring spectra. In [Invent. Math. 167, No. 3, 615--667 (2007; Zbl 1118.18010)], \textit{B. Toen} introduced the notions of derived Azumaya algebra and derived Brauer group. He proved that the derived Brauer group \(\mathrm{dBr}(X)\) (the group of Morita equivalences of derived Azumaya algebras over \(X\)) of a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme \(X\) is isomorphic to \(H^1_{\mathrm{\'et}}(X,\mathbb{Z})\times H^2_{\text{ét}}(X,\mathbb{G}_m)\). In [Geom. Topol. 18, No. 2, 1149--1244 (2014; Zbl 1308.14021)], \textit{B. Antieau} and \textit{D. Gepner} proved a similar result in the setting of Lurie's derived algebraic geometry over ring spectra and applied the notion of Brauer sheaf to uniqueness results about the stable homotopy category.

The goal of the present paper is to generalize and unify the theory of Azumaya algebras and Brauer groups above in a homotopical setting. For this, the author discusses Azumaya objects in closed autonomous symmetric monoidal bicategories and provides a characterization theorem of such objects. When the ambient bicategory is triangulated, he gives moreover a new characterization in terms of localization. The homotopical Brauer group is then defined as the group of \(1\)-cell equivalence classes of Azumaya objects. The author proves that his homotopical Brauer group agrees with the notions of Brauer groups introduced in [\textit{A. Baker} et al., J. Pure Appl. Algebra 216, No. 11, 2361--2376 (2012; Zbl 1345.55003)] and B. Toën [loc. cit.], and also proves that the derived Brauer group of a commutative ring in the sense of Toen agrees with the Brauer group of the corresponding Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectrum.",0

Here this is replaced by the single condition \\(H^0(D,\\operatorname {End}E\\otimes N_{D/S}^{-k})=0\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) and it is shown that the full moduli functor is represented even by a scheme. The proof does not need geometric invariant theory and is based on interpreting the moduli problem as a subfunctor of a Quot-functor over a relative Grassmannian.

A function \\(f\\) on \\(V\\) is called \\({\\mathfrak U}\\)-rational if it is rational and its poles are contained in \\(\\cup {\\mathfrak U}.\\) The author develops an approach in calculating sums \\(B_{f,{\\mathfrak U}} = \\sum_{j\\in \\Gamma_{\\mathfrak U}} f(j)\\), or more generally, the Fourier series \\(B_{f,{\\mathfrak U}}(t) = \\sum_{j \\in \\Gamma_{\\mathfrak U}} f(j)\\exp\\langle t,j\\rangle\\), \\(j \\in V^\\ast\\), where the function \\(f\\) is \\({\\mathfrak U}\\)-rational. It is proved that \\(V^\\ast\\) has a chamber decomposition which comes from one of \\(T = V^\\ast/\\Lambda\\) and the series \\(B_{f,{\\mathfrak U}}(t)\\) restricts to a polynomial inside each chamber.

His constructions are essentially based on the notion of iterated residue of \\({\\mathfrak U}_{\\mathbb C}\\)-meromorphic functions where \\({\\mathfrak U}_{\\mathbb C}\\) is the complexification of the arrangement \\({\\mathfrak U}\\).

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem. So, once we know how to reread the proofs, this kind of abstract theory contains an algorithm which computes the concrete result (here, the sum of squares required by Hilbert). Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\n\n\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof. They are replaced by dynamic evaluations of DAS. We think that we have given, for an academic example, a new method, realizing a kind of Hilbert Program for significant parts of classical algebra.","Summary: The bullwhip effect in which the demand in the upstream section of a supply chain is distorted gives rise to an unfavourable phenomenon. Most of the existing research studies have investigated the bullwhip effect under a single sourcing environment. However, in this research the behaviour of the bullwhip effect under a dual sourcing environment for a first-order autoregressive [\(AR(1)\)] demand process using an analytical approach is examined. The conditions under which the bullwhip effect is reduced in the dual sourcing environment in comparison to that in the single sourcing environment are subsequently derived.",0

Kennzeichnend fÃ¼r einen reellen ZahlkÃ¶rper ist es, daÃŸ in ihm eine Summe von Quadraten dann und nur dann verschwindet, wenn jeder Summand Null ist. DemgemÃ¤ÃŸ heiÃŸt ein abstrakter KÃ¶rper \\textit{reell}, wenn in ihm \\(-1\\) nicht als Quadratsumme darstellbar ist. Ein reeller KÃ¶rper hat stets die Charakteristik 0. Nennt man einen KÃ¶rper \\textit{geordnet}, wenn fÃ¼r jedes Element \\(a\\) eine und nur eine der Beziehungen \\(a=0\\), \\(a>0\\), \\(-a>0\\) besteht, und wenn dabei mit \\(a>0\\) und \\(b>0\\) auch \\(a+b>0\\) und \\(ab>0\\) gilt, so ist, wie man leicht sieht, jeder geordnete KÃ¶rper reell.\n\nEin KÃ¶rper \\(P\\) heiÃŸt \\textit{reell} \\textit{abgeschlossen}, wenn \\(P\\), aber keine algebraische Erweiterung von \\(P\\), reell ist. Ist \\(\\gamma\\) ein Element aus \\(P\\), das in \\(P\\) kein Quadrat ist, so zeigt eine Quadratsummendarstellung von \\(-1\\) in \\(P(\\sqrt{\\gamma})\\), daÃŸ \\(\\gamma\\) auch nicht Quadratsumme in \\(P\\) sein kann, daÃŸ dagegen \\(-\\gamma\\) in \\(P\\) Quadratsumme ist und daher auch Quadrat sein muÃŸ. Von den beiden Elementen \\(\\gamma\\) und \\(-\\gamma\\) ist also eines und offenbar nur eines Quadrat. Man erhÃ¤lt nun eine -- und zwar die einzig mÃ¶gliche -- Ordnung von \\(P\\) durch die Festsetzung: positiv (\\(>0\\)) sind alle und nur die von Null verschiedenen Elemente von \\(P\\), deren Quadratwurzel in \\(P\\) liegt. Jeder reell abgeschlossene KÃ¶rper kann also auf eine und nur eine Weise geordnet werden (Satz 1).\n\nEin indirekter Beweis fÃ¼hrt durch einen InduktionsschluÃŸ nach dem Grad des Polynoms zu dem Ergebnis: In \\(P\\) besitzt jedes Polynom ungeraden Grades wenigstens eine Nullstelle (Satz 2). Die Gleichung \\(x^2+1=0\\) ist in \\(P\\) nicht lÃ¶sbar. Also: ein reell abgeschlossener KÃ¶rper ist nicht algebraisch abgeschlossen; er wird dagegen algebraisch abgeschlossen durch Adjunktion einer Nullstelle \\(i\\) von \\(x^2+1=0\\) (Satz 3). Denn wenn in einem geordneten KÃ¶rper \\(K\\) Satz 2 gilt und aus jeder positiven Zahl die Quadratwurzel ausgezogen werden kann, fÃ¼hren die SchlÃ¼sse des zweiten \\textit{GauÃŸ}schen Beweises fÃ¼r den Fundamentalsatz der Algebra zum Beweis der algebraischen Abgeschlossenheit von \\(K(i)\\). Eine von \\textit{E. Artin} schon frÃ¼her angewendete SchluÃŸweise [Hamb. Math. Abh. 3, 319--323 (1924; JFM 50.0104.01)] ergibt dann: Jeder UnterkÃ¶rper \\(P\\) eines algebraisch abgeschlossenen KÃ¶rpers \\(\\varOmega\\) von der Charakteristik 0, aus dem \\(\\varOmega\\) durch eine einfache Erweiterung hervorgeht, ist reell abgeschlossen (Satz 4). Da im reell abgeschlossenen KÃ¶rper \\(P\\) jedes Polynom \\(f(x)\\) in irreduzible lineare und quadratische Faktoren zerfÃ¤llt, gilt ferner: Wenn fÃ¼r zwei Elemente \\(a\\), \\(b\\) aus \\(P\\,f(a) > 0\\) und \\(f(b) < 0\\) wird, so gibt es zwischen \\(a\\) und \\(b\\) wenigstens ein Element \\(c\\) in \\(P\\), fÃ¼r das \\(f(c)= 0\\) wird (Satz 5). Dieser Satz bildet die Grundlage fÃ¼r die Ã¼blichen Beweise der SÃ¤tze der reellen Algebra. In einem reell abgeschlossenen KÃ¶rper gelten also die SÃ¤tze der reellen Algebra, z. B. der Satz von \\textit{Rolle}, der \\textit{Sturm}sche Satz usw. (Satz 6).\n\nDurch einen WohlordnungsschluÃŸ wird der Existenzsatz bewiesen: Ist \\(K\\) reell, \\(\\varOmega\\) algebraisch abgeschlossen Ã¼ber \\(K\\), so gibt es wenigstens einen reell abgeschlossenen KÃ¶rper \\(P\\) zwischen \\(K\\) und \\(\\varOmega\\), so daÃŸ \\(\\varOmega=K(i)\\) (Satz 7). Eine unmittelbare Folgerung daraus ist, daÃŸ jeder reelle KÃ¶rper geordnet werden kann. WÃ¤hlt man in Satz 7 speziell \\(\\varOmega\\) algebraisch Ã¼ber \\(K\\), so ist auch \\(P\\) algebraisch Ã¼ber \\(K\\). Genauer gilt: Zu einem geordneten KÃ¶rper \\(K\\) gibt es eine und -- bis auf Ã¤quivalente Erweiterungen - nur eine algebraische reell abgeschlossene Erweiterung \\(P\\), deren Ordnung eine Fortsetzung der Ordnung von \\(K\\) ist; in \\(P\\) ist der identische Automorphismus der einzige, der \\(K\\) elementweise fest lÃ¤ÃŸt (Satz 8).

Wenn also \\(P\\) reell abgeschlossen Ã¼ber \\(K\\) ist, so sind alle in bezug auf \\(K\\) maximal-archimedischen UnterkÃ¶rper von \\(P\\) reell abgeschlossene und Ã¤quivalente Erweiterungen von \\(K\\) (Satz 9).\n\nIst \\(K\\) QuotientenkÃ¶rper eines geordneten Ringes \\(R\\), so gibt es eine und nur eine Ordnung von \\(K\\), die in \\(R\\) mit der gegebenen Ã¼bereinstimmt; man erhÃ¤lt sie durch die Festsetzung: \\(\\dfrac{b}{c}>0\\) \\((c\\neq0)\\) dann und nur dann, wenn \\(bc>0\\). Da der Ring der ganzen rationalen Zahlen nur auf eine Weise geordnet werden kann, gibt es nach Satz 8 einen und bis auf Isomorphie nur einen reell abgeschlossenen absolut algebraischen KÃ¶rper, den KÃ¶rper der (im gewÃ¶hnlichen Sinn) reellen algebraischen Zahlen.

Several results on restriction of roots in the case of a subtorus action on an affine toric variety are obtained.,"One can begin with the abstract of the authors:

``We study the general problem of extremality for metric Diophantine approximation on submanifolds of matrices.We formulate a criterion for extremality in terms of a certain family of algebraic obstructions and show that it is sharp. In general the almost sure Diophantine exponent of a submanifold is shown to depend only on its Zariski closure, and when the latter is defined over \(\mathbb Q\), we prove that the exponent is rational and give a method to effectively compute it. This method is applied to a number of cases of interest. In particular we prove that the Diophantine exponent of rational nilpotent Lie groups exists and is a rational number, which we determine explicitly in terms of representation theoretic data''.

The authors  declare the following goals of this paper:

-- ``to answer a question of \textit{V. Beresnevich} et al., [J. Théor. Nombres Bordeaux 27, No. 1, 1--31  (2015; Zbl  1375.11053)] asking for the right criterion for a submanifold of matrices to be extremal''. The relevance of this problem is justified  in terms of the authors' scientific research.

-- to derive consequences for nilpotent Lie groups.

The main results presented in this paper can be divided into two groups.

The first group contains the following three results: a result  on the Diophantine exponent for rational manifolds (the list of problems that are answered by this result is given); a result such that deals with  the inheritance from Plücker closure; a result on bounds for the Diophantine exponent.

The second group of the main results is results regarding Diophantine approximation on nilpotent Lie groups. That is, a theorem on existence of the exponent  and ``zero-one law'' (zero-one law implies this theorem), a theorem on rationality and stability of the exponent are proved. Also, the existence of a critical exponent for any simply connected nilpotent real Lie group (not necessarily defined over \(\mathbb Q\)) is shown. A computation of  this exponent under the group is defined over the rationals, is  explained and rationality conjecture is formulated.

In addition, an explicit computation of the critical exponent of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group is presented, a theorem on critical exponent for the Heisenberg group is proved.

Let us note that the  essence and applications of methods used in the present article are explained. Finally, the Kleinbock-Margulis method and the Dani correspondence, which allows to reformulate the Diophantine approximation problem in terms of orbits in the space of lattices, are considered.

Auxiliary theorems are proved, notions, and examples are considered. Also, auxiliary surveys on results related to the topic of this paper and evaluation of these results are given. The authors present some open problems.",0

Let \\(s_i=(q_1/p,\\ldots,q_d/p)\\) with \\(q_1,\\ldots,q_d\\in \\mathbb Z_{\\geq0}\\), \\(p>0\\) and \\(\\gcd(q_1,\\ldots,q_d,p)=1\\) be the slope of \\(s_i\\) and \\(h_i>0\\) be the height of \\(s_i\\); \\(h=h_1+\\cdots+h_d\\) is the height of \\(N(f)\\). Let \\(f\\in \\mathbb C\\{x\\}[z]\\) be q.o, and choose P-good coordinates for \\(f\\). We assume that \\(f\\) is of order \\(>1\\) in \\(z\\). Let \\(s=(q_1/p,\\ldots,q_d/p)=(\\overline q_1/\\overline p_1,\\ldots,\\overline q_d/\\overline p_d)\\) with \\(\\gcd (\\overline q_i,\\overline p_i)=1 \\) for \\(i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,d\\}\\) be the slope of a line segment \\(\\mathcal E\\) of \\(N(f)\\); then we may write \\(f_{\\mathcal E}(x,z)=x^nz^{n_{d+1}}\\prod_{j=1}^k(z^p-\\mu_hx^q)\\) with \\(n\\in\\mathbb Q_{\\geq0}^d\\) and \\(\\mu_j\\in\\mathbb C^*\\). Now choose \\(j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}\\) and \\(\\alpha_j\\in\\mathbb C^*\\) with \\(\\alpha_j^p=\\mu_j\\). The Newton map corresponding to these data is the morphism \\(\\sigma_{s,\\alpha_j}: \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb C\\{y\\}[z_1])\\to \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb C\\{x\\}[z])\\) defined by \\(x_i\\mapsto y_i^{\\overline p_i}\\), \\(z\\mapsto \\prod_i(y_i^{\\overline q_i}(\\alpha_j+z_1)\\). Then \\(f\\circ \\sigma_{s,\\alpha_j}(y,z_1)\\in\\mathbb C\\{y\\}[z_1]\\) can be written as \\(y^ef_1(y,z_1)\\) where \\(f_1\\in\\mathbb C\\{y\\}[z_1]\\) is q.o. In general, \\(f_1\\) is not in P-good coordinates; also, if \\(f\\) is irreducible, then \\(f_1\\) is, in general, not irreducible---a phenomenon of false reducibility which was detected and analyzed by the author in his thesis [FunciÃ³n zeta motÃ­vica de singularidades quasiordinarias irreducibles. Tesis Doctoral, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (2010)].\n\nNow we can repeat these steps for the q.o polynomial \\(f_1(y,z_1)\\). This procedure can be repeated until we reach some \\(f_k\\) of order \\(1\\) in \\(z_k\\). This situation always appears after a finite number of steps; such a sequence of iterations is called the Newton process for the q.o polynomial \\(f\\). From a result of \\textit{P. D. GonzÃ¡lez PÃ©rez} [Can. J. Math. 52, No. 2, 348--368 (2000; Zbl 0970.14027)] it follows that the Newton process is independent of the choice of P-good coordinates.\n\nIf \\(f\\) is irreducible, the output of the Newton process is a q.o branch \\(\\zeta\\) from which one may read the characteristic exponents of \\(f\\) (Proposition 3.8). A Newton process determines also if \\(f\\) is irreducible (Theorem 4.9). In Proposition 5.3 the author shows under what conditions all the iterations of \\(f\\) in a Newton process remain irreducible. Lastly, the author---in case \\(d=2\\)---gives a sufficient condition for the normalization of a q.o surface singularity defined by an irreducible q.o polynomial \\(f\\) to be smooth; here he uses results of \\textit{P. D. Gonzalez Perez} [Ann. Inst. Fourier 53, No. 6, 1819--1881 (2003; Zbl 1052.32024)] and \\textit{P. Popescu-Pampu} [C. R., Math., Acad. Sci. Paris 336, No. 8, 651--656 (2003; Zbl 1038.32024)]. In an appendix the author illustrates graphically a Newton process associated to a q.o polynomial \\(f\\) and compares this illustration with the Newton trees introduced in the papers of \\textit{E. Artal Bartolo} et al. [Mem. Am. Math. Soc. 841, 85 p. (2005; Zbl 1095.14005); Contemp. Math. 538, 321--343 (2011; Zbl 1214.14004)]; [Mosc. Math.

1144539,Summary: We present an algorithm for obtaining the matter content of effective six-dimensional theories resulting from compactification of \\(F\\)-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds which are hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The algorithm allows us to read off the matter content of the theory from the polyhedron describing the Calabi-Yau manifold. This is based on the generalized Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation condition.,"Summary: We argue that M-theory compactified on an arbitrary genus-one fibration, that is, an elliptic fibration which need not have a section, always has an F-theory limit when the area of the genus-one fiber approaches zero. Such genus-one fibrations can be easily constructed as toric hypersurfaces, and various \\({\\mathrm{SU}}(5)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1)^n\\) and \\(E_6\\) models are presented as examples. To each genus-one fibration one can associate a \\(\\tau\\)-function on the base as well as an \\({\\mathrm{SL}}(2,\\mathbb Z)\\) representation which together define the IIB axio-dilaton and 7-brane content of the theory. The set of genus-one fibrations with the same \\(\\tau\\)-function and \\({\\mathrm{SL}}(2,\\mathbb Z)\\) representation, known as the Tate-Shafarevich group, supplies an important degree of freedom in the corresponding F-theory model which has not been studied carefully until now.\n\n Six-dimensional anomaly cancellation as well as Witten's zero-mode count on wrapped branes both imply corrections to the usual F-theory dictionary for some of these models. In particular, neutral hypermultiplets which are localized at codimension-two fibers can arise. (All previous known examples of localized hypermultiplets were charged under the gauge group of the theory.) Finally, in the absence of a section some novel monodromies of Kodaira fibers are allowed which lead to new breaking patterns of non-Abelian gauge groups.",1

In the first part, the authors review some basic material about affine toric varieties and then they study more general ones. Their main concern are those toric varieties, not necessarily normal, that can be covered by a finite number of affine open sets, each one invariant under the action of the torus. For these, they provide a combinatorial description, in terms of fans where to each of their cones a finitely generated semigroup is attached, subject to suitable gluing conditions. Henceforth, ``toric variety'' will mean one in this sense. They discuss a number of properties of these varieties and other related concepts, such as invertible sheaves, ampleness, projectivity and blowing-ups with equivariant sheaves of ideals as centers. The blown-up variety is again toric. They emphasize the mentioned combinatorial description in their study.\n\nIn the second part they study in detail certain blowing-ups, namely those whose center is the \\textit{logarithmic Jacobian ideal} of the toric variety \\(X\\). The resulting variety is again toric, and if the base field has characteristic zero, this process agrees with the Semple-Nash modification of \\(X\\), where each point is replaced by the limit positions of tangent spaces at nearby regular points. This is more commonly called the Nash modification (or blow-up) of \\(X\\), but it seems that this process appeared for the first time in [\\textit{J. G. Semple}, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) 4, 24--49 (1954; Zbl 0055.14505)].\n\nThey prove that, starting from a toric variety \\(X\\) and a monomial valuation \\(V\\) of maximal rank of its function field, dominating a point \\(x\\) of \\(X\\), successive blowing-ups centered at log Jacobian ideals uniformize the valuation. That is, we reach the situation of a toric variety \\(X'\\) and a regular point \\(x' \\in X'\\), lying over \\(x\\), such that the valuation dominates \\(x'\\). The proof is complicated, and throughout they use the combinatorial description of the first part. In particular, in characteristic zero the uniformization is obtained by repeated application of the Semple-Nash modification.\n\nIn the final sections of the article they re-interpret their uniformization result in terms of the Zariski-Riemann space of the fan associated to the toric variety \\(X\\), which involves the preorders of an underlying lattice, introduced in [\\textit{G.

Localization of Chern classes and the associated topological residues are discussed. The localization of characteristic classes is also discussed from differential geometric point of view.

To describe the localization of Chern classes the Chern-Weil theory is modified that it is adapted to the ÄŒech-de Rham cohomology.

In some sense, the description of noncommutative projective curves that was begun in the earlier paper can thus be considered complete.\n\n\nLet \\(R\\) be a semiprime, Noetherian, connected graded \\(k\\)-algebra of quadratic growth. The description of \\(R\\) in terms of geometric data proceeds, roughly speaking, along the following lines: Let \\(Y\\) be a projective variety of dimension \\(\\leq 1\\) over the base field \\(k\\) and let \\(\\mathcal E\\) be an \\({\\mathcal O}_Y\\)-order in a finite dimensional semisimple algebra \\(A\\) over the field \\(K=k(Y)\\).

Algebra 184, No. 2, 435-490 (1996; Zbl 0876.17011)], a Noetherian ``twisted homogeneous coordinate ring'' can be constructed as \\(B=\\bigoplus_n H^0(Y,{\\mathcal B}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes{\\mathcal B}^{\\tau^{n-1}})\\).

It also explain some motivation which involves the character ratios for an irreducible representation of a finite group. It is very readable and contains many historical facts. In the body of the article, several novel definitions of ranks (called \(U\)-rank, tensor rank, and asymptotic rank) for representations of classical groups over finite fields were introduced. For a representation of \(\mathrm{GL}_n\), the \(U\)-rank involves the largest rank among all \(U\)-isotropic components of the representation, as \(U\) varies all standard unipotent matrix subgroups of \(\mathrm{GL}_n\), while the tensor rank describes the exact integer \(k\), as the representation sits in \(k\)-fold tensor products of \(U\)-rank \(1\) irreducible representations. The asymptotic rank is another rank between them. A low \(U\)-rank representation is a kind of representation whose \(U\)-rank double is strictly smaller than \(n\). For other classical groups, these definitions were given based on the authors' recently works [Prog. Math. 323, 209--234 (2017; Zbl 1405.20036)]. It should be mentioned that the \(U\)-rank \(1\) irreducible representations of \(Sp\) consists of the four components of Weil representations. In this paper, the authors also propose several conjectures. One conjecture is the following: for \(\mathrm{GL}\) and \(\mathrm{Sp}\), the \(U\)-rank and tensor rank of a low \(U\)-rank representation are the same.

To construct representations of a given rank, the authors develop a method called eta correspondence.

1133084,"Summary: We introduce the notion of ``Dynamic Algebraic Structure'' (DAS) inspired by Dynamic Evaluation (in computer algebra) and Model Theory. We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem.

Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\(0=1\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof.

This approach is motivated on the one hand by the known situation in the projective case, where the geometry of moduli spaces is deeply connected with the underlying variety, and on the other hand by the complexity of open problems in affine algebraic geometry. From this viewpoint, it is natural to choose trivial framings on the divisor to reduce its contribution to the moduli space.\n\n\n In the first part, we check that trivial framings fulfill known criteria for the existence of moduli spaces, especially the absence of nontrivial automorphisms. By proving the invariance under blow-ups, we obtain due to the weak factorization theorem for birational maps indeed a direct relation of the moduli to the complement of the divisor. In the following, we investigate examples for surfaces (especially the complex projective plane) in the hope of possible applications to affine classification problems. However, it turns out that contrary to the the known cases of framings on rational curves the condition of trivial framings is rather restrictive. In higher dimension, a trivial framing on an ample divisor implies even the global triviality of the bundle. Hence, one cannot expect to obtain invariants for the open questions in the classification of affine varieties in higher dimension from this construction.\n\n\n Therefore, we consider in the second part the question of how the rigid triviality condition might be weakened without losing the property of being an invariant of the complement. A crucial notion is that of trivial multiframings, i.e., trivial framings on the components of the divisor. Here, a slighly weaker invariance holds; but the existence of moduli spaces cannot be concluded from known general results. Consequently, we formulate the related moduli problem, and investigate the deformation theory of component-wise trivial bundles. In the case of a reduced divisor, we can describe the underlying topological structure of multiframings. Then, we find an obstruction to lift trivial multiframings to higher multiplicities and the formal completion of the divisor. In dimension \\(\\geq 3\\), we conclude from general theory that the extension to the whole space is unique. However, it turns out that for concrete examples the objects and obstructions are difficult to calculate, especially in the exceptional cases relevant for the affine classification. Therefore, the question whether the developed tools are sufficiently powerful to solve open problems in affine geometry like the cancellation problem for exotic affine structures remains open.",1

Consider the equation \((*)\) \(L(z, \partial_t) u(z) = f(z)\) defined in a neighborhood \(\Omega\) of \(z = 0\) in \(\mathbb{C}^{n + 1}\), let \(K = \{z \in \Omega, z_0 = 0\}\) (here \(z = (z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_n))\) be a connected smooth characteristic hypersurface, and suppose that \(f(z)\) and \(u(z)\) are holomorphic in a sector \(\Omega (\theta_0)\), whose edge is \(K\). Suppose moreover that \(u(z)\) has at most exponential growth on \(\Omega (\theta_0)\) and \(f(z)\) has some asymptotic expansion with bounds on \(\Omega (\theta_0)\). Under some conditions on the characteristic indices of \(L(z, \partial_z)\), \(u(z)\) has an asymptotic expansion of the same type as \(f\). This type of results gives, as particular cases, the existence of holomorphic solutions.

 for any \(N\) as \(z_0 \to 0\) in any \(\Omega_0 (a',b') \times D\), with \(D \Subset \Omega'\), and the \(a_k(z') \in {\mathcal O} (\Omega')\) (if \(k = \infty\), \(f \in \text{Asy}_{+ \infty} \Omega (a,b)\) means that \(f \in {\mathcal O} (\Omega))\). By \(\widetilde {\mathcal M} - \text{Asy}_{(K)} (\Omega (a,b))\) the author means the class of all \(f \in {\mathcal O} (\Omega (a,b))\) having an asymptotic expansion with polar and logarithmic terms as \(z_0 \to 0\). The main results are that (under some conditions on the characteristic indices), if \(f \in \text{Asy} (\Omega (\theta_0))\) and \(u \in {\mathcal O}_{(\gamma) } (\Omega (\theta_0)\) then \(u \in \text{Asy}_{(k)} (\Omega (\theta_0))\) (respectively if \(f \in \widetilde u - \text{Asy}_{(K)} (\Omega (\theta_0))\) then \(u \in \widetilde {\mathcal M} - \text{Asy}_{ (k)} (\Omega (\theta_0))\), where \(\Omega (\theta_0)\) is the sector \(\{z \in \Omega \backslash \{z_0 = 0\}\), \(|\arg z_0 |< \theta_0\}\), \({\mathcal O}_{(\gamma)} (\Omega (a,b))\) is the set of holomorphic functions such that
\[

If \((\xi_n)_n\) is a sequence of independent Poisson random variables with parameter \(w_n\) such that \(\lim_{n\to \infty} n w_n = \infty\) and \(w_n = b(n)/ n\), where \(b (n)\) is a function of ``slowly variation'', then the random set \(\Lambda = \{ n \geq 1\,;\;\xi_n > 0\}\) is almost surely uniformly distributed in the Bohr group.

Trajectories of the chain are considered until some ``valid'' stopping time \(\tau\). This time is defined in the following way.


A set of all pairs of states (i,j) is divided on three subsets: \(S_ 1\), \(S_ 2\), \(S_ 3\). Each pair (i,j) is labelled by a number \(v_{ij}\). Let the present state of the chain be \(\xi_ n=i\) and the next one \(\xi_{n+1}=j\). If \((i,j)\in S_ 1\) then we put \(\tau =n+1\) and do not consider an appropriate trajectory after this time. If \((i,j)\in S_ 2\) then we put \(\tau =\infty\) and also do not consider the trajectory at all. If \((i,j)\in S_ 3\) then \(\tau >n+1\) and the trajectory is developing further.


The authors suggest linear algebraic equations for probabilities \(g_ i=p(\tau <\infty | \xi_ 0=i)\).

The material is also used to give an account of patterns of theory change in Indian philosophy of mathematics.


The theory of number under consideration ``is an account of the semantics and epistemology of contingent numerical quantities'' (p.\ 413). Numericals are treated as numerical predicates, numbers are properties of objects. Several problems and their solutions given by historical authors are discussed, among them the `number of qualities' problem: if numbers are qualities, do qualities have a number? This is a special case of the problem of self-inherence which occurs in speaking of the one number one. Another problem discussed is the problem of cross-categoricity: ``If we can speak about the number of things in any category, then in what category do we place numbers themselves?'' (p.\ 417). A solution of these problems could be seen in the rejection of the classical opinion that numbers were qualities as was done within the school by \textit{Bhāsarvaja} (c.\ 950). According to him number adjectives stand for relations of identity and difference. \textit{Praśastapāda}'s (c.\ 530) `eight moments' theory goes beyond the classical theory by giving ``a detailed description of the ontogenesis of numbers, and of the psychological process by which they come to be cognised'' (p.\ 421).


Further topics discussed are the objectivity of numbers regarded as real objects including the epistemological question how to perceive numbers. One of the different conceptions supports the hypothesis that mathematical truths are known with the help of a special source of knowledge, called `inclusion' (p.\ 426). The meaning of indefinite number terms like `many' is discussed, just as the role of mathematical demonstration, the goal of which was ``to bring the readers to the point where they really understand how and why theorem or rule is correct'' (p.\ 433).


The empirical grounding of the theory of number is most important. It leads to special patterns of theory change, provoked by a perceived explanatory failure in the older theory or ``by a perceived mismatch between the older theory of a concept and the actual use of that concept in a range of cases'' (p.\ 431). The search for inconsistencies or paradoxes did not drive the philosophical practice.",0

Several results are related to the case of real algebraic CR submanifolds \\(M\\) of \\(\\mathbb{C}^N\\). It is shown that the CR orbit of every \\(p\\in M\\) is a real algebraic submanifold of \\(M\\), and the intrinsic complexification \\(X\\) of this orbit is a complex algebraic submanifold of \\(\\mathbb{C}^N\\). If \\(H\\) is the germ of a biholomorphic map in a neighbourhood in \\(\\mathbb{C}^N\\) of \\(p\\in M\\), mapping \\(M\\) into another real algebraic manifold of the same dimension, then the restriction of \\(H\\) to the complex algebraic manifold \\(X\\) is algebraic. \n\n\nRemarkably, the algebraicity results in this paper are deduced from analyticity properties of locally defined objects. The so-called Segre sets play a central methodical role. These are sequences of sets which are attached to the points of a real analytic CR manifold. The concept of these sets is described in detail and generalizes the concept of the so-called Segre surfaces which has been used before by other authors.\n\n\nThe paper also contains a brief historical survey about previous work on the algebraicity of holomorphic mappings between real algebraic sets in \\(\\mathbb{C}^N\\).",1

1491052,"The authors investigate the graded minimal free resolutions of certain modules over two types of rings:\n\n\n(i) the Segre product of \\(K[X_1, \\dots,X_m]\\) and \\(K[Y_1,\\dots, Y_n]\\), and\n\n\n(ii) the \\(d\\)-th Veronese subalgebra of \\(K[X_1, \\dots,X_m]\\).\n\n\nBoth these rings are affine semigroup rings. The structure of their minimal free resolutions with respect to the natural representation as a residue class ring is determined by simplicial complexes that are isomorphic to matching and chessboard complexes (with \\(d=2\\) in case (ii)).\n\n\nOn the other hand, these rings are naturally presented as residue class rings of polynomial rings modulo the 2-minors of generic (or, in case (ii), \\(d=2\\), symmetric) matrices of indeterminates, and their minimal free resolutions have been determined in characteristic 0 by Lascoux, Pragacz, Weyman and others by methods of representation theory. The authors extend these results to certain naturally defined modules over the mentioned rings, characterize the Cohen-Macaulay ones among them, and transfer the information available for ideals of minors to chessboard and matching complexes.\n\n\n[The result on the Cohen-Macaulay property of Segre\\((m,n,r)\\) has previously been proved: \\textit{A. Guerrieri}, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 127, No. 3, 657-663 (1999; Zbl 0915.13008)].","Summary: Topological properties of the matching complex were first studied by \\textit{S. Bouc} [J. Algebra 150, 158--186 (1992; Zbl 0786.55005)] in connection with Quillen complexes, and topological properties of the chessboard complex were first studied by \\textit{P. F. Garst} [Cohen-Macaulay complexes and group actions, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison (1979)] in connection with Tits coset complexes. \\textit{A. BjÃ¶rner, L. LovÃ¡sz, S. T.

Ser. 49, 25--39 (1994; Zbl 0790.57014)] established bounds on the connectivity of these complexes and conjectured that these bounds are sharp. In this paper we show that the conjecture is true by establishing the nonvanishing of integral homology in the degrees given by these bounds. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently large \\(n\\), the bottom nonvanishing homology of the matching complex \\(M_{n}\\) is an elementary 3-group, improving a result of Bouc, and that the bottom nonvanishing homology of the chessboard complex \\(M_{n,n}\\) is a 3-group of exponent at most 9. When \\(n\\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\), the bottom nonvanishing homology of \\(M_{n,n}\\) is shown to be \\(\\mathbb Z_3\\). Our proofs rely on computer calculations, long exact sequences, representation theory, and tableau combinatorics.",1
1717472,"In contrast to the case of line bundles, which can be described in terms of the cohomology with values in the usual de Rham complex, connections on a principal bundle with non-abelian structure group lead to the theory of differential forms with values in a Lie algebra or its adjoint group. These objects possess a considerably richer structure; for instance, they are endowed with a non-trivial Lie algebra structure, and the differentials form no longer a complex but fulfil certain\nrelations which reflect in low degrees both the Maurer-Cartan equation and the Bianchi identity.\nIn the paper under review, the authors adapt the approach of \\textit{A. Kock} [Synthetic differential geometry (London Mathematical Lecture Note Series, 51, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc.) (1981; Zbl 0466.51008); Bull. Aust. Math. Soc. 25, 357--386 (1982; Zbl 0484.58005)] to these objects by using the following combinatorial definition. Let \\(X/S\\) be an \\(S\\)-scheme and let \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\subset X^{n+1}\\) be the subscheme of pairwise infinitesimally close \\((n+1)\\)-tuples of points. Then a \\(\\text{Lie}(G)\\) valued \\(n\\)-form, for an \\(S\\)-group scheme \\(G\\), is an \\(S\\)-morphism \\(\\Delta^n_{X/S}\\rightarrow G\\). The authors give a substantial survey of these objects and related results, taking into account several technical subtleties in the general scheme-theoretic context.","Given a morphism \\(X \\rightarrow S\\) of log schemes, a universal sheaf \\(\\Omega^1_{X/S}\\) of relative logarithmic differential forms is well-defined [see \\textit{K.

Perrin} [``Sur la classification des courbes gauches'', AstÃ©risque 184-185 (1990; Zbl 0717.14017)], in the present paper the author studies \\(H_{d,g}\\) in the case \\(g=(d-3)(d-4)/2\\).","Let \\(X_d := H_{d,g}\\) be the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay, equidimensional curves in \\({\\mathbb P}^3_k\\). The curves are not assumed to be smooth or reduced, and \\(k\\) is an algebraically closed field. This paper considers the case \\(g = (d-3)(d-4)/2\\), with the goal of describing the families of such curves, such that none of these families is a specialization of any other. As was done initially by \\textit{M. Martin-Deschamps} and \\textit{D. Perrin} [``Sur la classification des courbes gauches'', AstÃ©risque 184-185 (1990; Zbl 0717.14017)] and subsequently by several authors, the work centers around a study of the Rao module \\(M_C := \\bigoplus_{n \\in {\\mathbb Z}} \\text{H}^1({\\mathcal I}_C (n))\\) and a stratification of the Hilbert scheme using this module. \n\n\nThe case \\(g = (d-3)(d-4)\\) is the first non-trivial and interesting case, since \\(d\\leq 3\\) is understood as is \\(g > (d-3)(d-4)/2\\). The author describes the possible Rao modules for curves in \\(X_d\\), the general element of each irreducible component and the dimension of these components. A classification is given for when the curves can be smooth and connected, and finally a proof is given that \\(X_d\\) is connected for \\(d \\geq 4\\). An important ingredient is the notion of \\textit{extremal} curves, namely those whose Rao modules have maximum possible dimension. This has been studied by several authors, and a connection to the connectness of the Hilbert scheme was also made by \\textit{S. Nollet} [Commun. Algebra 28, 5745-5747 (2000; Zbl 0991.14002)] when \\(g > (d-3)(d-4)/2\\).",1
