It ends with the most clear description of what mirror symmetry is: They could be pairs of complex manifolds (both with trivial tangent bundle) producing the same physics for string compactification, but with the corresponding \\\\(A\\\\)-model and \\\\(B\\\\)-models exchanged. In particular there should be formulas relating the \\\\(A\\\\)-model correlation functions of one manifold (which count the number of rational curves) with the \\\\(B\\\\)-model correlation functions of the other (which are related to period integrals). -- The next chapters give a highly readable account of all the pieces involved in mirror symmetry, counting rational curves in Calabi-Yau threefolds, Gromov-Witten invariants how they encode \\\\(A\\\\)-model correlation functions, quantum cohomology, moduli of sigma models, geometric variations of the Hodge structure and its relationship with \\\\(B\\\\)-model correlation functions, and \\\\(A\\\\)-variations of the Hodge structure (related to the geometric variations on the mirror). \\n\\n\\nThe last chapter deals with mirror symmetry itself and describes the different geometric models (or definitions) for the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau known in 1994. The first model is the \\\\textit{B. R. Green} and \\\\textit{A. R. Plesser} orbifold construction [Nucl. Phys. B 338, No. 1, 15-37 (1990)]; the second one is due to \\\\textit{V. V. Batyrev} [J. Algebr. Geom. 3, No. 3, 493-535 (1994; Zbl 0829.14023)] and works for an arbitrary family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties.

More popular conjectures or ``mirror symmetry tests'', like the presence of isomorphisms between certain Hodge spaces preserving correlation functions, are also explained. The paper includes also some computations that give evidences supporting the mirror symmetry conjectures. As the author says, the subject of mirror symmetry is a rapidly developing one, and very much has been done since 1994.\\n\\n\\nThe paper includes a postscript sketching some of these developments until 1997, most of them still alive and producing new and interesting open problems. We list some of the theories described:\\n\\n\\nThe generalization and simpler definition of the Gromov-Witten invariants, including the purely algebraic theory of \\\\textit{M.

The more important are the so-called type \\\\(IIA\\\\) and type \\\\(IIB\\\\) string theories.

This is related to ``\\\\(D\\\\)-brane moduli spaces'' and with \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(F\\\\) dualities. \\n\\n\\nThe paper finally refers to one of the most interesting formulations of mirror-symmetry, the theory of \\\\textit{A. Strominger, S.-T. Yau} and \\\\textit{E. Zaslow} [Nucl. Phys., B 479, No. 1-2, 243-259 (1996; Zbl 0896.14024)]. In this approach the phenomenon of mirror symmetry on Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting a \\\\(T^3\\\\) fibration is interpreted as \\\\(T\\\\)-duality on the \\\\(T^3\\\\) fibres. According to this formulation one would like to take the mirror dual to a Calabi-Yau manifold as a compactification of the moduli space of its special Lagrangian submanifolds (the \\\\(T^3\\\\) tori in the above case) endowed with a suitable complex structure. The author himself [``The geometry underlying mirror symmetry'', in: New Trends in Algebraic Geometry, Sel. Papers Eur-Conf., Warwick 1996, Lond. Math. Soc. Lect. Notes Set. 264, 283-310 (1999)] gave a geometric construction of mirror symmetry consistent with YSZ recipe, showing that the relationship between quantum cohomology and the variation of the Hodge structure should conjecturally follow as a consequence. For elliptic K3 surfaces and Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau threefolds, \\\\textit{M. Gross} and \\\\textit{P. M. H. Wilson} [Math. Ann. 309, No. 3, 505-531 (1997; Zbl 0901.14024)] showed that the already known geometric models of mirror symmetry are consistent with SYZ.\\n\\n\\nThe paper is a very good introduction to the subject, and explains very clearly the different mathematical theories involved in mirror symmetry and the relationships among them. It covers all aspects of the topic up to date when it was written and is then highly recommendable both to those wishing to get familiar with mirror symmetry and to know the relevant literature (it includes 153 references) and to those wishing to understand the mathematical aspects of this fascinating subject.\",\n",

We show that this constructive notion allows a rereading of the Artin-Schreier-Robison solution for the 17th Hilbert Problem.

Our method gives a constructive semantics for certain parts of abstract classical mathematics.\\n\\n\\nThe idea is the following: replace the classical algebraic structures ``constructed'' by Choice and Principle of Third Excluded Middle (TEM), by DAS and dynamic evluations of these DAS. Then TEM is replaced by construction of branching in the trees of dynamic evaluation of the DAS. If Choice is used in the form of Gödel's completeness theorem, it is not really necessary to use it for obtaining concrete results: in DAS, Choice is simply replaced by \\\\dots nothing! This is because the classical proof is by contradiction: ``if there were not a sum of squares then some formal theory would admit a pathological model''. The constructive reasoning is more direct: since the pathological theory proves \\\\(0=1\\\\) we know how to construct the sum of squares \\\\dots and classical models have disappeared in the proof.

The main result of the paper under review is a bound for the degree of a finite surjective mapping \\\\(f: X\\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^n\\\\), namely, \\\\(\\\\deg(f)\\\\geq 2^{[\\\\sqrt n]}\\\\), where \\\\([~]\\\\) denotes the integer part. It appears somewhat unexpected that this bound is almost exponentially, but it comes out very natural from just two ingredients. First, the nef condition ensures the existence of points \\\\(x\\\\in X\\\\) where \\\\(df_x\\\\) drops rank substantially, since the locus \\\\(S_k=\\n\\\\{x\\\\in X\\\\mid\\\\operatorname{rank} df_x\\\\leq n-k \\\\}\\\\) (whose expected dimension is \\\\(n-k^2\\\\)) can be shown to be non-empty for \\\\(k=[\\\\sqrt n]\\\\). On the other hand, the local degree of \\\\(f\\\\) at such points must be larger than \\\\(2^k\\\\). Indeed, the authors indicate that this bound may be far from being optimal, and may be seen as a suggestion that the projective geometry associated to non-negative varieties grows rapidly with the dimension. \\n\\n\\n In the second part, this result is applied to subvarieties of abelian varieties, and it is shown that the top self-intersection of its canonical bundle is bounded from below by \\\\(2^{[\\\\sqrt n]}\\\\). Furthermore, some variants of the estimate are given.']"
